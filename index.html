PYREX� brand kitchen glass was the first product that allowed one to prepare, cook, and store in the same piece, and as the twentieth century progressed, PYREX� options increased and color was added. You can usually tell what year a person got married by the color of the PYREX� in the kitchen cabinet! This expanded edition explores those colors along with the clear ovenware, Flameware, laboratory glass and now for the first time, restaurantware.

Paper jams, mangled pages, and even fires made early versions of this clunky office machine a source of fear, rage, dread, and disappointment. But eventually, xerography democratized print culture by making it convenient and affordable for renegade publishers, zinesters, artists, punks, anarchists, queers, feminists, street activists, and others to publish their work and to get their messages out on the street. The xerographic copier adjusted the lived and imagined margins of society, Eichhorn argues, by supporting artistic and political expression and mobilizing subcultural movements. </p><p>Eichhorn describes early efforts to use xerography to create art and the occasional scapegoating of urban copy shops and xerographic technologies following political panics, using the post-9/11 raid on a Toronto copy shop as her central example. She examines New York's downtown art and punk scenes of the 1970s to 1990s, arguing that xerography&#x2015;including photocopied posters, mail art, and zines&#x2015;changed what cities looked like and how we experienced them. And she looks at how a generation of activists and artists deployed the copy machine in AIDS and queer activism while simultaneously introducing the copy machine's gritty, DIY aesthetics into international art markets.</p><p>Xerographic copy machines are now defunct. Office copiers are digital, and activists rely on social media more than photocopied posters. And yet, Eichhorn argues, even though we now live in a post-xerographic era, the grassroots aesthetics and political legacy of xerography persists.</p></p><p>Kate Eichhorn is Associate Professor of Culture and Media Studies at the New School. She is the author of <i>The Archival Turn in Feminism</i>.<p>This is a compelling and well-researched book that offers vivid examples of the&nbsp;deep political significance that became attached to these concrete acts of reproduction and dissemination.</p>&#x2015;<i>LSE Review of Books</i></p><h2>Silas Marner</h2><p>Silas Marner, a simple, religious man, angrily retreats from his community and church when he is unjustly accused of theft. In an isolated cottage, Silas spends his days weaving cloth and his nights sifting through the piles of gold he obsessively accumulates. Then, one New Year&#39;s Eve, a little girl, Eppie, appears at his home, and his life is miraculously transformed. Eliot&#39;s timeless tale includes an Introduction by David Carroll.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.Embittered by a false accusation, disappointed in friendship and love, the weaver Silas Marner retreats into a long twilight life alone with his loom. . . and his gold. Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works. It is more nearly a masterpiece; it has more of that simple, rounded, consummate aspect. . .which marks a classical work." -- Henry James</p></p><h2>Society of Six: California Colorists</h2><p>Six plein-air painters in Oakland, California, joined together in 1917 to form an association that lasted nearly fifteen years. The Society of Six&#x2015;Selden Connor Gile, Maurice Logan, William H. Clapp, August F. Gay, Bernard von Eichman, and Louis Siegriest&#x2015;created a color-centered modernist idiom that shocked establishment tastes but remains the most advanced painting of its era in Northern California. Nancy Boas's well-informed and sumptuously illustrated chronicle recognizes the importance of these six painters in the history of American Post-Impressionism.<br><br>The Six found themselves in the position of an avant garde not because they set out to reject conventionality, but because they aspired to create their own indigenous modernism. While the artists were considered outsiders in their time, their work is now recognized as part of the vital and enduring lineage of American art. Depression hardship ended the Six's ascendancy, but their painterliness, use of color, and deep alliance with the land and the light became a beacon for postwar Northern California modern painters such as Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne Thiebaud. Combining biography and critical analysis, Nancy Boas offers a fitting tribute to the lives and exhilarating painting of the Society of Six.</p><p>When these six artists first banded together in 1917, the San Francisco art establishment found their work raw and undeveloped. According to Nancy Boas, however, these painters represent the first fully evolved reflection of modern art on the West Coast. Her scholarly and engaging study is tantamount to a discovery of a previously unknown group of painters, and it is unusual in that it recounts the birth of modern art in a nonurban setting. She elegantly and convincingly balances biography with analysis, intertwining six personal stories into a much larger story, which is really about the birth of modernism, an integral segment of America&#39;s artistic heritage. These artists&#39; works are expressive, energetic, and ablaze with vivid color, reminiscent of a quality of rarefied light found in Richard Diebenkorn&#39;s Ocean Park series or Vincent van Gogh&#39;s Arles paintings."The Oakland Six may constitute the most important modernist development that occurred in this country during the 1920s."&#x2015;William H. Gerdts, author of <i>American Impressionism</i></p><h2>The Way to Vibrant Health</h2><p>The Way to Vibrant Health, now in its 3rd printing, represents over 20 years of Bioenergetic body-psychotherapy techniques.

Author Rothbard blames government interventionist policies for magnifying the duration, breadth, and intensity of the Great Depression. He explains how government manipulation of the money supply sets the stage for the familiar "boom-bust" phases of the modern market which we know all too well. He then details the inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve from 1921 to 1929 as evidence that the depression was essentially caused not by speculation, but by government and central bank interference in the market. Clearly we find history tragically repeating itself today. A must-read.</p><p><p><strong>Murray N.

Clover traces Eurasianism&#x2019;s origins in the writings of White Russian exiles in 1920s Europe, through Siberia&#x2019;s Gulag archipelago in the 1950s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and up to its steady infiltration of the governing elite around Vladimir Putin. This eye-opening analysis pieces together the evidence for Eurasianism&#x2019;s place at the heart of Kremlin thinking today and explores its impact on recent events, the annexation of Crimea, the rise in Russia of anti-Western paranoia and imperialist rhetoric, as well as Putin&#x2019;s sometimes perplexing political actions and ambitions.<br><br> Based on extensive research and dozens of interviews with Putin&#x2019;s close advisers, this quietly explosive story will be essential reading for anyone concerned with Russia&#x2019;s past century, and its future.</p><p>In this timely, thought-provoking study, the former Moscow bureau chief for the <i>Financial Times</i> argues that a dangerous &#x201c;Eurasianist&#x201d; ideology in modern-day Russia helps to explain the sometimes perplexing actions and ambitions of Vladimir Putin and explores what it portends for the future of the Eastern European nations.American journalist <b>Charles Clover</b> is currently the <i>Financial Times</i>&#x2019;s China correspondent.

These works of commercial art featured unique designs, irregular shapes, dynamic compositions, and neon light. The legendary fiesta dancer at the Albuquerque Terrace drive-in theater, for example, was well-known for the grace of its lines, its enormous size, and its flashing neon skirt. Created during a time before the simplified icons of major chains, many of these culturally significant artworks no longer exist. <em>The Zeon Files</em> rescues these historic artifacts from obscurity, presenting a collection of the working drawings of historic Route 66-era signs. In addition to presenting a visually rich archive, the authors discuss the working methods of design and construction and the craft of drafting techniques during this innovative era of American sign making.</p></p><p><strong>Mark C.

Charles Freeman&#x2019;s meticulous historical account of Christianity from its birth in Judaea in the first century A.D. to the emergence of Western and Eastern churches by A.D. 600 reveals that it was a distinctive, vibrant, and incredibly diverse movement brought into order at the cost of intellectual and spiritual vitality. Against the conventional narrative of the inevitable &#x201c;triumph&#x201d; of a single distinct Christianity, Freeman shows that there was a host of competing Christianities, many of which had as much claim to authenticity as those that eventually dominated. Looking with fresh eyes at the historical record, Freeman explores the ambiguities and contradictions that underlay Christian theology and the unavoidable compromises enforced in the name of doctrine.</p><p>Tracing the astonishing transformation that the early Christian church underwent&#x2014;from sporadic niches of Christian communities surviving in the wake of a horrific crucifixion to sanctioned alliance with the state&#x2014;Charles Freeman shows how freedom of thought was curtailed by the development of the concept of faith. The imposition of "correct belief," religious uniformity, and an institutional framework that enforced orthodoxy were both consolidating and stifling. Uncovering the difficulties in establishing the Christian church, he examines its relationship with Judaism, Gnosticism, Greek philosophy and Greco-Roman society, and he offers dramatic new accounts of Paul, the resurrection, and the church fathers and emperors.</p></p><p><b>Charles Freeman</b> is a specialist on the ancient world and its legacy. He has worked on archaeological digs on the continents surrounding the Mediterranean and develops study tour programs in Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Freeman is Historical Consultant to the prestigious Blue Guides series and the author of numerous books, including the bestseller <i>The Closing of the Western Mind</i> and, most recently, <i>Holy Bones, Holy Dust</i>. He lives in the UK."Freeman has a gift for crafting a compelling story out of the messy details of history, painting nuanced portraits of key figures through compelling quotations and precise historical observation."&#x2015;Steve Young, <i>Library Journal</i><br><p>"[Freeman] surveys a surprisingly diverse range of early Christian communities, differing from one another in doctrine, devotional observances, and attitudes toward pagan philosophy. But in the narrative that he presses most insistently, Freeman recounts how small and politically marginal bands of Christians&#x2015;subject to savage persecution&#x2015;transformed into an imperially powerful church serving Roman emperors (notably, Constantine and Theodosius) and persecuting heretics unwilling to embrace the creeds those emperors helped to hammer out."&#x2015;Bryce Christensen, <i>Booklist</i></p><br>"[Freeman] surveys a surprisingly diverse range of early Christian communities, . . . [and] recounts how small and politically marginal bands of Christians. . . transformed into an imperially powerful church serving Roman emperors (notably, Constantine and Theodosius) and persecuting heretics unwilling to embrace the creeds those emperors helped to hammer out."&#x2015;Bryce Christensen, <i>Booklist</i><br>"It's a mighty undertaking in such a modestly sized volume, but if you want to understand the reasons for present day schisms, you'll find the answers in this well-reasoned book."&#x2014;Dave Wood, <i>the Red Wing Republican Eagle</i><br>". . . a masterful work that adds to the knowledge of Christian history."&#x2014;Kevin Winter, <i>sacramentobookreview.com</i><br>"A fresh and provocative book: insightful, adventurous and controversial."&#x2014;Laurie Guy, <i>Colloquium</i><br><p>"Freeman rigorously maintains a nonjudgmental approach to the breadth of Christian diversity . . . A nuanced and sophisticated presentation of the dialogues (both within and outside of the tradition) that shaped the Christian experience through the fifth century. . . . This book will likely become the standard text for introductory courses."&#x2014;David M. Reis, <i>Religious Studies Review</i></p><br>"This book combines clear descriptions with a large amount of detail, presenting them in manageable bits, so that even the interested lay reader will find this book accessible with a little study. . . . Much to Freeman's credit and to the benefit of&nbsp;readers, he leads them through the years in which Christianity was shaped by these imperial forces, considering to what extent these were internal and external changes. This book is a great addition to the bookshelf of both educators and pastors who are interested in the origins of Christianity."&#x2014;Andrea Janelle Dickens, <i>Interpretations</i><br>"As usual, Freeman writes clearly and avoids the tediousness that can afflict scholarly texts."&#x2014;Randal Hunhoff, <i>Arkansas Democrat Gazette</i><br>"<i>A History of Early Christianity</i> is a masterful book, and a pleasure to read. Freeman narrates the development, diversity, and spread of Christianity with originality and verve. It is a story that brims over with fascinating accounts, intriguing quotations from figures in the ancient Mediterranean, and illuminating historical analysis. It is also a crucial resource for our understanding of ongoing cultural negotiations of religious and political spheres, all those theologico-political paradoxes that face us now more than ever. I do not think there exists a more engaging and illuminating history of early Christianity than this one."&#x2014;Ward Blanton, University of Glasgow<br>"Even those who are adherents to Christianity may be puzzled by the tensions which exist in its primary sources, and this meticulous attempt to probe its origins and development is to be welcomed. Charles Freeman embraces the different kinds of approaches and positions which are found in the ancient texts, Christian and otherwise, painting a vivid picture of the nature of Christianity in all its diversity in the earliest centuries of its existence."&#x2014;Christopher Rowland, author of <i>Christian Origins</i><br> <p>"This is a bold and imaginative historical synthesis which fills an important need. For the first time, Freeman makes the complex story of Christianity's birth and early development available in concise, lively, eminently readable form. A tragic story in many ways, but a great pleasure to read."&#x2014;Richard Rubenstein, author of <i>When Jesus Became God</i></p><br></p><h2>Classical Sociological Theory</h2><p><p>Now with SAGE Publishing, and co-authored by one of the foremost authorities on sociological theory, George Ritzer and Jeffrey Stepnisky&#x2019;s <strong>Classical Sociological Theory<em>, Seventh Edition</em></strong>, provides a comprehensive overview of the major theorists and schools of sociological thought from the Enlightenment roots of theory through the early 20th century.

Geographically and culturally boundless, with contributions from Great Britain, Ireland, America, Canada, Australia, India, the Caribbean, and Southern Africa; influenced by great novelists working in other languages; and encompassing a range of genres, the story of the novel in English unfolds like a richly varied landscape that invites exploration rather than a linear journey. In <i>The Novel: A Biography, </i>Michael Schmidt does full justice to its complexity.</p><p>Like his hero Ford Madox Ford in <i>The March of Literature</i>, Schmidt chooses as his traveling companions not critics or theorists but "artist practitioners," men and women who feel "hot love" for the books they admire, and fulminate against those they dislike. It is their insights Schmidt cares about. Quoting from the letters, diaries, reviews, and essays of novelists and drawing on their biographies, Schmidt invites us into the creative dialogues between authors and between books, and suggests how these dialogues have shaped the development of the novel in English.</p><p>Schmidt believes there is something fundamentally subversive about art: he portrays the novel as a liberalizing force and a revolutionary stimulus. But whatever purpose the novel serves in a given era, a work endures not because of its subject, themes, political stance, or social aims but because of its language, its sheer invention, and its resistance to clich�--some irreducible quality that keeps readers coming back to its pages.</p></p><p>Michael Schmidt is Professor of Poetry at the University of Glasgow and a writer in residence at St John's College, Cambridge. He is founder and editorial and managing director of Carcanet Press and for more than four decades editor of <i>PN Review</i>, the literary magazine."<i>The Novel</i> isn't just a marvelous account of what the form can do; it is also a record, in the figure who appears in its pages, of what it can do to us. The book is a biography in that sense, too. Its protagonist is Schmidt himself, a single reader singularly reading." -- William Deresiewicz, <i>The Atlantic </i><br><br>"What vindicates Schmidt's willful stopping of his ears to the irrelevant chatter of academic scholarship is that he himself reads so intelligently and writes so pungently. He doesn't need the latest instruction from the ivory tower -- nor, he implies, should we... [...] Griping is, after all, out of place when set against Schmidt's achievement: a herculean literary labor, carried off with swashbuckling style and critical aggression. Forster and the others will enjoy talking to Michael Schmidt when he joins them at the heavenly table." John Sutherland, <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Handbook on German Military Forces</h2><p><p>In March, 1945, the U.S. War Department issued a restricted document called Handbook on German Military Forces. The restricted classification was removed in 1953, but the handbook has until now remained virtually unknown. The book is a massive compendium of information on every aspect of Hitler&#x2019;s forces. It gives credence to the contention that by 1945 U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall may have known more about the German military than did Hitler himself.</p><p>Exceptionally well organized and exhaustively detailed, the handbook examines German military personnel from the lowest levels to the High Command. It describes the Wehrmacht&#x2019;s administrative structure, unit organization, field tactics, fortification and defense systems, weapons and other equipment, and uniforms and insignia. Moreover, it presents this abundance of information in a manner that is remarkable for its depth and clarity.</p><p>The book contains an astute analysis of the psychology of the German soldier and charts the ways in which the attitudes of Hitler&#x2019;s men changed over the course of the war. It also considers the strengths and weaknesses of the German weapons systems, describes how Allied soldiers could make use of captured weapons, and offers advice on how Allied military personnel might avoid being captured themselves. Hundreds of tables, organizational charts, and illustrations, some in color, add further value to the book.</p><p><i>Handbook on German Military Forces</i> will prove indispensable to scholars of World War II as well as to all devotees of military history.</p></p><p>With an Introduction by Stephen E.

Newcomers to Stephenson should reject any trepidation. This science-fueled saga spans millennia, but make no mistake: The heart of this story is its all-too-human heroes and how their choices, good and ill, forge the future of our species. <em>Seveneves</em> launches into action with the disintegration of the moon. Initially considered only a cosmetic, not cosmic, change to the skies, the moon&#x2019;s breakup is soon identified as the spawning ground of a meteor shower dubbed the Hard Rain that will bombard Earth for thousands of years, extinguishing all life from the surface of the planet. Now humanity has only two years to get off-world and into the Cloud Ark, a swarm of small, hastily built spaceships that will house millions of Earth species (recorded as digital DNA) and hundreds of people until they can return home again. But who goes, and who stays? And once the lucky few have joined the Cloud Ark, how will the remaining seeds of humankind survive not only the perils of day-to-day of life in space but also the lethal quicksand of internal politics? Slingshot pacing propels the reader through the intricacies of orbit liberation points, the physics of moving chains, and bot swarms, leaving an intellectual afterglow and a restless need to know more. An epic story of humanity and survival that is ultimately optimistic, <em>Seveneves </em> will keep you thinking long past the final page. <em>--Adrian Liang</em></p><p>From the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Anathem</em>, <em>Reamde</em>, and <em>Cryptonomicon</em> comes an exciting and thought-provoking science fiction epic&#x2014;a grand story of annihilation and survival spanning five thousand years</p><p><em>What would happen if the world were ending? </em></p><p>A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.</p><p>But the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remains . . .&nbsp; Five thousand years later, their progeny&#x2014;seven distinct races now three billion strong&#x2014;embark on yet another audacious journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth.</p><p>A writer of dazzling genius and imaginative vision, Neal Stephenson combines science, philosophy, technology, psychology, and literature in a magnificent work of speculative fiction that offers a portrait of a future that is both extraordinary and eerily recognizable.

It also provides a careful summary of the modern political changes that have affected the social and cultural development of all modern cultures. <br> <br> Throughout the book's lifetime, <i>A History of the Modern World</i> has been hailed as an elegantly written historical narrative, filled with analysis and balanced historical insights as well as its traditional attention to the processes of historical change, conflict, and political transformations.

Do they strive for creative perfection throughout decades of painstaking and frustrating experimentation, or do they achieve it confidently and decisively, through meticulous planning that yields masterpieces early in their lives?</p><br><p> By examining the careers not only of great painters but also of important sculptors, poets, novelists, and movie directors, <i>Old Masters and Young Geniuses</i> offers a profound new understanding of artistic creativity. Using a wide range of evidence, David Galenson demonstrates that there are two fundamentally different approaches to innovation, and that each is associated with a distinct pattern of discovery over a lifetime.</p><br><p> Experimental innovators work by trial and error, and arrive at their major contributions gradually, late in life. In contrast, conceptual innovators make sudden breakthroughs by formulating new ideas, usually at an early age. Galenson shows why such artists as Michelangelo, Rembrandt, C�zanne, Jackson Pollock, Virginia Woolf, Robert Frost, and Alfred Hitchcock were experimental old masters, and why Vermeer, van Gogh, Picasso, Herman Melville, James Joyce, Sylvia Plath, and Orson Welles were conceptual young geniuses. He also explains how this changes our understanding of art and its past.</p><br><p> Experimental innovators seek, and conceptual innovators find. By illuminating the differences between them, this pioneering book provides vivid new insights into the mysterious processes of human creativity.</p></p><p><p>"[A] really wonderful book. . . .

Little children come into the world hardwired to learn in virtually any setting and about any matter. Yet in today&#x2019;s preschool and kindergarten classrooms, learning has been reduced to scripted lessons and suspect metrics that too often undervalue a child&#x2019;s intelligence while overtaxing the child&#x2019;s growing brain. These mismatched expectations wreak havoc on the family: parents fear that if they choose the &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; program, their child won&#x2019;t get into the &#x201c;right&#x201d; college. But Yale early childhood expert Erika Christakis says our fears are wildly misplaced. Our anxiety about preparing and safeguarding our children&#x2019;s future seems to have reached a fever pitch at a time when, ironically, science gives us more certainty than ever before that young children are exceptionally strong thinkers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her pathbreaking book, Christakis explains what it&#x2019;s like to be a young child in America today, in a world designed by and for adults, where we have confused schooling with learning. She offers real-life solutions to real-life issues, with nuance and direction that takes us far beyond the usual prescriptions for <i>fewer tests, more play</i>. She looks at children&#x2019;s use of language, their artistic expressions, the way their imaginations grow, and how they build deep emotional bonds to stretch the boundaries of their small worlds. Rather than clutter their worlds with more and more stuff, sometimes the wisest course for us is to learn how to get out of their way. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christakis&#x2019;s message is energizing and reassuring: young children are inherently powerful, and they (and their parents) will flourish when we learn new ways of restoring the vital early learning environment to one that is best suited to the littlest learners. This bold and pragmatic challenge to the conventional wisdom peels back the mystery of childhood, revealing a place that&#x2019;s rich with possibility.</p><p><b>Erika Christakis</b> is an early childhood educator and school consultant.

Learned, balanced, and hopeful, this compellingly argued and engagingly written work will not only take its place as a standard reference on early childhood education but, because &#x2018;we are all someone&#x2019;s child,&#x2019; will be of great interest to everyone concerned with the future of our nation and democratic culture.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Orlando Patterson, John Cowles Professor of Sociology, Harvard, and author of <i>Slavery and Social Death</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A brilliant, altogether original, impeccably researched but also deeply heartfelt call to action.

Parents, caregivers, teachers, and policy makers could have no surer guide through this morass than Erika Christakis. With scientific acumen, irreverent good sense, and a novelist&#x2019;s eye for human detail, Christakis offers us a judicious view of the new and old realities of bringing up children.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and the author of <i>The Language Instinct</i> and <i>The Blank Slate</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>"Remarkably well-researched, erudite and concise, Erika Christakis offers parents and teachers alike a developmentally informed perspective on how preschool children learn best, along with a no-nonsense prescription for how to get them there. . . .

Her prose sparkles. . . . Her critique of America&#x2019;s early childhood programs is sharp, but humane. . . . There&#x2019;s no underestimating children here: this woman is on their side. . . . Her faith in &#x201c;these strong, small characters&#x201d; infuses the book with moral authority, which she wears lightly, revealing her foibles as a professional and parent, and dispensing folksy wisdom from her own vividly evoked childish escapades. . . . [W]e abandon [Christakis&#x2019;s argument] at our peril.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2014;ECE Policy<i>Matters</i></b></i><br><br>"Christakis, offering both research and anecdotal history, covers all the bases: the need for quality teacher training, the dearth of male representation, the effect of low salaries, top-down imposition of 'nitpicky, decontextualized standards,' technology and screen-time, social-emotional learning, parent/teacher relationships, and more. Although the author thinks it will take years to turn early childhood education around, she never doubts the innate capability of young children to flourish, at home and in school, when they are given the right support and enough time to do so. Perhaps the most important takeaway from this thought-provoking, timely discussion is that children and adults need to be allowed the opportunity to develop meaningful relationships and to get to know and trust one another, because, as Christakis concludes, 'the most essential engine of child development is not gadgetry or testing, but deep human connection.' It&#x2019;s an observation well worth considering."<br><i><b>&#x2014;School Library Journal<br><br></b></i>&#x201c;Sometimes a book&#x2019;s message strikes me as perfect for its time. Such was my reaction to the Importance of Being Little....Christakis makes a powerful, research-based case for why the way we have been educating our young children is not working...I very much hope parents will read her book to better understand what constitutes an authentic and meaningful early childhood education. And Christakis&#x2019;s message will almost certainly resonate with teachers, administrators, and educational policy makers, as well.&#x201d;<i><br> <b><i><i>&#x2014;</i>Alternet<br><br></i></b></i>&#x201c;Weaving together recent research with real-life anecdotes and analogies, Christakis honors the complexity of young children and helps readers better appreciate children&#x2019;s vulnerabilities and strengths. . . .

It provides a sound introduction to linguistic methodology while encouraging students to consider why people are intrinsically interested in language&#x2015;the ultimate puzzle of the human mind.</p><p>The text first treats such structural and interpretive parts of language as morphology, phonology, syntax, and semantics, then takes a cognitive perspective and covers such topics as pragmatics, psychology of language, language acquisition, and language and the brain. For this sixth edition, all chapters have been revised. New material includes updated examples, new special topics sections, and new discussions of the minimalist program, semantic minimalism, human genetic relationships and historical relationships among languages, Gricean theories, experimental pragmatics, and language acquisition. </p><p>The organization of the book gives instructors flexibility in designing their courses. Chapters have numerous subsections with core material presented first and additional material following as special topics. The accompanying workbook supplements the text with exercises drawn from a variety of languages.

A landmark work of impressive scope, the book is enhanced by 700 halftone illustrations and 150 drawings especially prepared by architect Richard Tobias.<br> Kostof's range of study includes not only the monumental religious, governmental and upper-class structures around which architectural history has usually been written but also the diversity of ordinary domestic, rural, and urban buildings, and landscapes which surround them. Moreover, Kostof evaluates Western achievement in the context of contemporary cultures elsewhere. Thus he duscusses the high points of imperial Rome along with Buddhist stupas and Han palaces, compares medieval Florence with medieval Cairo, and introduces Inca and Aztec cities as the Spanish conquistadores would have seen them.<br> The author's premise is that buldings are conditioned by the social, economic, and political frame of their time; in this sense, Kostof concludes, the history of architecture can be considered an aspect of the history of human institutions. "Architecture, in the end," he writes, "is nothing less than the gift of making places for some human purpose."<br><br>About the Author:<br><br>Spiro Kostof is Professor of Architectural History at the University of California at Berkeley.

All Shakespeare's plays--from <em>As You Like It</em> and <em>All's Well that Ends Well</em> to <em>King Lear</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>--are covered in major articles. There are concise descriptions of allusions in Shakespeare (Ajax, Agamemnon), well-known critics (Samuel Johnson, John Dryden), great Shakespearian actors (Richard Burbage, Lawrence Olivier, Kenneth Branagh), characters in the plays (Mercutio, Ophelia), figures of speech (metaphor, metonymy, oxymoron), and much more. Longer articles explore topics such as Shakespeare's birthplace, censorship, the Chamberlain's Men, film, and Shakespeare's reception in such countries as China, Italy, and the United States.<br> Bringing its readers up to date not only with the latest in Shakespearian scholarship and controversy but with the plays' most recent incarnations on stage, film, and in international popular culture, this is the perfect companion to Shakespeare's works, covering everything from Aaron to Zeffirelli, and from Shakespeare in schools to <em>Shakespeare in Love</em>.</p><p><br><strong>Michael Dobson</strong> is Professor of Renaissance Drama at the University of Surrey Roehampton. He has also taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Harvard University, and Oxford. <strong>Stanley Wells</strong> is Chairman of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, and Professor of Shakespeare Studies Emeritus, and Director of the Shakespeare Institute, University of Birmingham. He has been the general editor of the Oxford Shakespeare since 1978.<br>It is difficult to think of a topic that is not touched upon in this new handbook designed "to inform readers about Shakespeare's works, times, lives, and afterlives." As one might expect, there are entries for the plays and sonnets, sources and themes, and significant people and places in Shakespeare's life, as well as for aspects of interpretation and performance over the years. What one might not expect are entries that throw light onto obscure details (<i>Mulberry tree</i>; <i>Performance times, lengths</i>; <i>Shakespeare Society of China</i>; <i>Trapdoors</i>), as well as those for topics that at first glance seem only remotely relevant (<i>Ceramics</i>; <i>Melville, Herman</i>; <i>Romania</i>; <i>Tobacco</i>). <p>Among the more than 3,000 signed entries are brief identifications of every character and in-depth treatments of each play. Articles on plays are several pages long and provide background information on text and sources, followed by plot summaries and discussions of artistic features, stage history, and screen presentations. Other entries cover biographical details, literary and cultural context, publishing history, literary terms, criticism, and scholarship. Particular emphasis is placed on theatrical history, from the productions of Shakespeare's time to <i>Royal Shakespeare Company</i>, <i>Silent films</i>, and <i>Television</i>. Notable players, from Thomas Betterton (1635-1710), "the greatest actor of the Restoration period," to Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, and Ian McKellen are included. Also represented are countries and regions, among them <i>Arab world</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and <i>Scandinavia</i>. Most entries are quite short, but broader topics, such as <i>Music, Nineteenth-century Shakespearian production</i>, and <i>Trade, travel, and colonialism</i>, are given at least a page. Many entries conclude with a brief list of resources. A detailed "Thematic Listing of Entries" helps compensate for the paucity of cross-references. Among other supplemental aids are a chronology and a bibliographic essay noting introductory studies and standard reference works. </p><p>Coeditor Wells also edited (with Gary Taylor) the modern-spelling edition of Oxford's <i>Complete Works</i> (1986) upon which the companion is based. In their introduction, Wells and Dobson admit to "some small bias" toward theaters in London and Stratford-upon-Avon. North American readers may take issue with the short shrift given to the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario, and its "Hollywood-like emphasis on costumes, props, and gimmicks." The entry <i>United States of America</i> talks about the Classics Illustrated comic-book versions of the plays and notes Shakespearian elements in television series such as <i>Gilligan's Island</i>, but does not mention the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, or any of the many other serious American enterprises devoted to Shakespeare's work. Some entries, such as <i>Cultural materialism</i>, will baffle nonspecialists. A few entry headings are arcane (movies are discussed under <i>Shakespeare on sound film</i>), and the lack of indexing means that information can be hard to retrieve. But its embrace of all things Shakespearian makes this volume a necessity for academic and public libraries. High-school libraries should also consider it, although high-schoolers may find Scribner's <i>Shakespeare's World and Work</i> [RBB S 1 01] more accessible. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This great empire, founded by Constantine as the seat of power in the East began to flourish in the fifth century AD, after the fall of Rome, yet its culture and history have been neglected by scholars in comparison to the privileging of interest in the Western and Roman Empire. Michael Grant's latest book aims to compensate for that neglect and to provide an insight into the nature of the Byzantine Empire in the fifth century; the prevalence of Christianity, the enormity and strangeness of the landscape of Asia Minor; and the history of invasion prior to the genesis of the empire.<br>Michael Grant's narrative is lucid and colourful as always, lavishly illustrated with photographs and maps. He successfully provides an examination of a comparatively unexplored area and constructs the history of an empire which rivals the former richness and diversity of a now fallen Rome.</p><p>Michael Grant, the noted classical historian, opens his newest book by observing that while most classicists can name the Roman emperors in chronological order, few can say anything about Byzantium other than that it was founded by Constantine in the aftermath of a vision in which Christianity became the official religion of his empire. Grant does much to educate his colleagues, and his many readers, in this well-written, heavily illustrated book about Byzantium's first century, when Rome fell to German invaders and Constantinople, far to the east, rose. Byzantium, Grant says, was "in many ways a pretty nasty place," thanks to a succession of despotic governments, civil wars, and intrigues. But it would last a thousand years and leave a mark on world history, still commanding our attention today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Michael Grant is author of numerous books, including, most recently, <i>Severans</i> (1996) and <i>Art in the Roman Empire</i> (1995), both published by Routledge.</p><h2>Betrayal: The Crisis in the Catholic Church</h2><p>Presents an account of sexual abuse of children by priests in the Catholic Church and how these crimes were covered-up by senior church officials.</p><p>The Boston Globe is one of the largest daily newspapers in America and in November 2001 they petitioned the Massachusetts Superior Court and forced the Boston Archdiocese to release secret documents - and won."...a classic example of what serious, long-form investigative reporting and dedicated community service by the press can accomplish..." -- <i>Buffalo News, 7/7/02</i><br><br>"...a terrible, horrible, awful book.

The book gives companies a definitive guide for sustaining their ability to learn and to improve operations and financial performance, while continually developing people. &#34;The only way to stay lean is to produce lean managers,&#34; says Jim Womack, author, lean management authority, and LEI founder. &#34;Every isolated effort will recede -- or fail -- unless companies learn to use the lean process as a way of developing individual problem-solvers with the ownership, initiative, and know-how to solve problems, learn, and coach new individuals.&#34; The Lean Manager, the sequel to the Ball�&#39;s international bestselling business novel The Gold Mine, tells the compelling story of plant manager Andrew Ward as he goes through the journey to becoming a lean manager. Under the guidance of Phil Jenkinson (whose own lean journey was at the core of The Gold Mine), Ward learns to use a deep understanding of lean tools, as well as a technical know-how of his plant&#39;s operations, to foster a lean attitude that sustains continuous improvement. He learns how to use tools to unleash the creativity and motivation of people, so they learn how to solve problems as well as coach and teach others to solve problems. &#34;I am excited and have hopes that this book will enlighten readers about what it really means to live a business transformation that puts customers first and does this through developing people,&#34; said Jeffrey Liker, author of The Toyota Way. &#34;People who do the work have to improve the work. There are tools, but they are not tools for &#39;improving the process.&#39; They are tools for making problems visible and for helping people think about how to solve those problems.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>A World History of Photography</h2><p>Bound in the publisher&#39;s original black cloth with the spine stamped in silver.

Author Gary Sloan brings more than thirty years' worth of acting experience to bear on the question of how to rehearse both as an individual actor and as part of the team of professionals that underpins any successful production. Interviews with acclaimed actors, directors, playwrights, and designers share a wealth of knowledge on dynamic collaboration.</p> <p>The book is divided in to three main stages, helping the reader to refine their craft in as straightforward and accessible manner as possible: </p> <ul> <li><em>In the world</em>:&nbsp;A flexible rehearsal program that can be employed daily, as well as over a typical four week production rehearsal.</li> <li><em>In the room</em>: Advice on working independently and productively with other members of a company, such as directors, playwrights, designers and technical crew; how your personal creative process varies depending on the role, be it Shakespeare, musicals, film, television or understudying.</li> <li><em>On your own</em>: Creating your own rehearsal process, exploring original and famous rehearsal techniques, breaking through actor's block and how to practice every day.</li></ul> <p><em>In Rehearsal</em> breaks down the rehearsal process from the actor&#x2019;s perspective and equips its reader with the tools to become a generous and resourceful performer both inside and outside the studio. Its independent, creative and daily rehearsal techniques are essential for any modern actor.</p></p><p><p><strong>'I loved discovering this book. I found Gary Sloan&#x2019;s writing current, fresh, smart and inspiring. The overall message of encouraging the actor to take responsibility for his own creative rehearsal process is conveyed with beautiful clarity and usefulness. It is an empowering guide for the actor who, too often, floats in a sea of unorganized questions and impulses until he finds his way. This book leaves nothing to chance and, ultimately, everything to a creative, courageous, collaborative and crafted freedom. It could easily become the modern bible for our beginning theater actor today.'</strong></p> <p><em>Janet Zarish, Head of Acting, NYU Graduate Acting Program, USA</em></p> <p><strong>'Sloan deftly defines the responsibilities an actor must bring to the creative environment inside a director&#x2019;s rehearsal process. However, his real gift is the blueprint of how every actor must explore, research, and prepare a role outside the rehearsal room. In my opinion, In Rehearsal should be required reading for all undergraduate actors.' </strong></p> <p><em>John David Lutz, Chair, Department of Theatre, University of Evansville, USA</em></p> <p><strong>'Everyone who is contemplating going into rehearsal for anything at all (the theatre, movies, television, life or just a walk in the park) should rush out and buy Gary Sloan's book - all the questions you might ever ask about the rehearsal process are addressed here and all kinds of solutions are offered but even more than the specific solutions the gold in the book is that it makes the reader understand that the profession of acting is a serious, noble, difficult, essentially human, often ridiculous, honorable, beautiful, HARD, glorious way to spend a life - this book is invaluable to people just getting started because it gives you a practice and a peek at anything and everything that might happen - for people who have been at it for the 20 years and more it is a companion to talk to and argue with and seek advice in and laugh with in that absolutely satisfying way you do when you come upon something that gets it absolutely RIGHT.'</strong></p> <p><em>Kathleen Chalfant, Actor </em></p> <p><strong>'[Sloan] talks with playwrights, dramaturgs, directors and fellow actors to explore how to interact most fruitfully with colleagues during rehearsal. (Short answer: Be polite, be willing to try anything and couch all discussions in terms of the character's need, not yours.) Sloan covers the particular requirements of film and television, where "rehearsal" is often limited to quickly setting the blocking. He illustrates his points with anecdotes (a few quite funny) from his own 30-year career, but this is at heart an earnest exhortation to actors to take their work seriously and honor the "profound responsibility [that comes] when you accept a role in a production...As for theatre's collaborative essence, that elemental theme is underscored...by Sloan...in the way [his] text [is] organized..reinforc[ing] the point by quoting liberally from interviews with other theatre professionals. Sloan comes off as ingenuously charming as he consults with costume, set and lighting designers to get their anwers to the question, "How is it any of [the actor's] business what the designers do?"'</strong></p> <p><em>Wendy Smith, American Theatre</em></p></p><h2>Reading the Middle Ages: Sources from Europe, Byzantium, and the Islamic World, Second Edition</h2><p><p>Covering over one thousand years of history and containing primary source material from the European, Byzantine, and Islamic worlds, Barbara H.

Cockshut wrote of Trollope's <i>Ralph the Heir</i>, " ... any reader who has previously subscribed to the stock idea of Trollope as a photographer and no artist, would be wise, if he wishes to be just, to consider these chapters carefully."<br>In <i>Ralph the Heir</i>, Anthony Trollope (1815&#x2013;1882) again constructs a multilayered Victorian society of the kind he so precisely imagined in the Palliser novels, the <i>Barsetshire</i> chronicles, and <i>The Claverings</i>. Trollope's favorite settings and themes thrive under his characteristically broad but subtly complex treatment. This forgotten but fine novel from his later years moves from country estates to London clubs, from Parliamentary elections to foxes, hounds, and fine horses. Property, illegitimacy and inheritance create the passions through which Trollope exercises his chief concern: character study.<br><i>Ralph the Heir</i> is a tale of decent people at the mercy of their own weaknesses. Trollope was never more ironic, rarely more perceptive, than in his portraits of Ralph Newton of London, idle wastrel and heir to a fortune; his namesake cousin, Ralph Newton of Hampshire, stained by illegitimacy; Clarissa Underwood, who trusted Ralph the heir, and the exotic orphan Mary Bonner, who preferred Ralph the bastard. Squire Newton of Newton Priory would atone for the great sin of his youth; Sir Thomas Underwood laments the vanity of his fading years. Under the misanthropic eye of Sir Thomas, each soul declares itself &#x2014; and each finally reaps his portion of virtue and of vice.</p><p>This novel tells a story of crossed inheritance. One Ralph Newton, a handsome ne&#39;er-do-well, has the expectation of the family property. His cousin (also Ralph Newton) is a wholly worthy fellow, but a bastard and may not by law inherit what his father desperately wants to bequeath him. This situation provides Trollope with the occasion for a profound analysis of moral worth and legal right. It is a novel of Trollope&#39;s maturity, featuring the darker hues and confident social criticism of his late phase together with streaks of broad comedy.As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841. The years in Ireland formed the basis of his second career delineating clerical life in small cathedral towns.</p><h2>France and the Dreyfus Affair: A Brief Documentary History (Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p>The Dreyfus affair &#x2014; the infamous account of Jewish army officer and French citizen, Alfred Dreyfus, unjustly convicted of treason in 1894 &#x2014; was the most significant political and social crisis of fin-de-si�cle Europe. In the first book designed to introduce students to the broad outlines and significant legacies of the affair, the author deftly interweaves text with documents, tracing the course of events. He highlights the many issues connected with the case, including anti-Semitism, militant nationalism, socialism, the birth of modern Zionism, and the separation of church and state. Sixty-six documents are embedded in the narrative, offering students a broad range of sources to examine, including newspaper editorials, letters, trial testimony, and diary entries. A list of the principal characters is included in the appendices.</p><p><b>Michael Burns</b> (Ph.D., Yale University) is professor of modern European history at Mount Holyoke College and has taught at Yale University and the �cole des Hautes �tudes.

Her movies and legacy continue to be cherished by millions all over the world. Kate was smart and independent at a time when those traits were often considered unbecoming in a woman.

This train� ing guide is an abridged version of the skills taught as part of a behavioral consultation model. As such it is not intended to be an exhaustive program in behavioral consultation. Usually, consultation skills are taught over a period of several months in university training programs. Also, the most successful use of the guidebook can be accom� plished only with prerequisite training in behavioral analysis and assessment as a method of delivering psychological services. Thus, individuals using this guidebook should obtain supervised training in this area. The book is also designed to accompany Bergan and Kratochwill (1990). Some individuals may have a background in behavioral assess� ment and intervention. In this case, the use of this guidebook can provide the user who has not been exposed to the specifics of the behavioral consultation approach valuable information regarding in� terviewing forms of assessment and intervention. Such activities can be extremely useful when incorporated into regular clinical work in applied settings and supplemented with other assessment and inter� vention methods. Given the importance of successful interviewing in applied settings, a major clinical tool should be available after careful study of this guidebook.</p><p></p><h2>The Nature of the Psyche: Its Human Expression, A Seth Book</h2><p>&#34;Western society has attempted to force all expression of love into sexual activity, or otherwise ban it entirely.

In recent decades this famous poem has become the subject of fresh and searching controversy. What is the poem&#x2019;s fundamental meaning? Does it endorse or undermine values of empire and patriarchy? Is its world view comic or tragic? Many studies of the poem have focused primarily on selected books. The approach here is comprehensive.</p><p>An introduction by editor Christine Perkell discusses the poem&#x2019;s historical background, its reception from antiquity to the present, and its most important themes.

This book features a selection of her work. Groover&#39;s early photographs - close-up and larger than life - brought critical acclaim and popularity, and although her work has become increasingly complex she continues to use ordinary household utensils and other everyday objects.</p><p>Groover's artful color photographs of kitchen utensils transform the mundane into the surreal. A picture might juxtapose a fork, vegetables and a spatula, creating a mysterious, elegant microworld in which familiar forms take on new meanings. This American photographer's precise yet richly colored triptychs of suburban New Jersey lawns and clapboard houses present suburbia as a sane refuge. Her calm, detached New York cityscapes of empty lots and abandoned buildings exude an almost perverse serenity. And her elaborate tabletop still-lifes of bottles, fruit, bones and goblets are darkly beautiful meditations on time and mortality. Groover's most recent pictures, sunny views of her new home in the French countryside, seem to be complex allegories on the interplay of nature and society. Szarkowski, former director of photography at Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art, limns Groover as an artist whose goal is to reinvent photography and to clarify its history. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Worldview Guide: Origin of Species (Canon Classics Literature)</h2><p>"<i>Origin of Species</i> is a must read for Christians in our secularized, Darwin-saturated society.

Long considered lost beyond recall, the architecture of ancient Alexandria has until now remained mysterious. But here Judith McKenzie shows that it is indeed possible to reconstruct the city and many of its buildings by means of meticulous exploration of archaeological remains, written sources, and an array of other fragmentary evidence.</p><p>The book approaches its subject at the macro- and the micro-level: from city-planning, building types, and designs to architectural style. It addresses the interaction between the imported Greek and native Egyptian traditions; the relations between the architecture of Alexandria and the other cities and towns of Egypt as well as the wider Mediterranean world; and Alexandria&#x2019;s previously unrecognized role as a major source of architectural innovation and artistic influence. Lavishly illustrated with new plans of the city in the Ptolemaic, Roman, and Byzantine periods; reconstruction drawings; and photographs, the book brings to life the ancient city and uncovers the true extent of its architectural legacy in the Mediterranean world.</p></p><p><b>Judith McKenzie</b> is member of the sub-faculty of archaeology, Oxford University.". . . a richly textured presentation. . . .

Indeed, spirituality is sometimes contrasted favorably with religion, which many people see (for good or ill) as an off-putting amalgam of dogma, moralism, institutions, buildings, and hierarchies. This <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, written by one of the most eminent scholars and writers on spirituality, explores the historical foundations of spirituality and considers how it came to have the significance it has today. The notion of spirituality, Philip Sheldrake notes, expresses the fact that many people are driven by goals that concern more than material satisfaction. Broadly, it refers to the deepest values and sense of meaning by which people seek to live. Sometimes these values are conventionally religious. Sometimes they are associated with what is understood as "the sacred" in a broader sense--that is, of ultimate rather than merely instrumental importance. Looking at spirituality in religion, philosophy, anthropology, and psychology, Sheldrake sheds light on the concept of the spiritual "experience" and considers the impact and transformation it can have on individuals and on society.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip Sheldrake</strong> is currently the Joseph Visiting Professor in the Department of Theology at Boston College. Sheldrake co-founded and directed (1984-94) the Institute of Spirituality at Heythrop College, University of London.

Is it morally distinctive? Can it be morally justified?<br> <br> Igor Primoratz seeks to overcome relativism and double standards that often plague debates about terrorism. He investigates the main ethical approaches to terrorism: in terms of its consequences, rights and justice, &#x201c;supreme emergency,&#x201d; and the collective responsibility of citizens. The book provides a rigorous, yet accessible analysis of a range of moral positions, from the acceptance of terrorism when its consequences are good on balance to its absolute rejection. Primoratz argues that terrorism is almost absolutely wrong. It may be morally justified only when an entire people is facing a true moral disaster, and this should be understood in a highly restrictive way.<br> Conceptual analysis and normative arguments about the practice of terrorism are complemented with case studies of terror-bombing of German cities in World War II and the role of terrorism in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br> <br> <i>Terrorism: A Philosophical Investigation</i>&nbsp;will be essential reading for researchers and students of philosophy and politics, and the general reader seeking to understand and evaluate acts and campaigns of terrorism.</p><p><b>Igor Primoratz </b>is professorial fellow in the Centre For Applied Philosophy &amp; Public Ethics at Charles Sturt University.<p>"Probably the best book on terrorism that there is."<br> <i><b>Times Higher Education</b></i><br> <br> "Very rich in content and is both clearly written and carefully thought out ... a provocative work that challenges widespread, deeply held moral, political, and historical beliefs.

In this way, the manager can ensure that the staff that has direct contact with the customer can do its job to ?sell? the restaurants? services. Service is treated differently in different types of foodservice operations, and this book addresses the mid and up-scale dining establishment. Remarkable Service can be used by a range of foodservice facilities to train staff, and can be used as a course textbook in culinary programs.</p><p>Topics include: <ul> <li>Dining room and kitchen organization and personnel</li> <li>Reservations, greeting, and seating</li> <li>Classic and modern styles of table service</li> <li>Beverage and wine service</li> <li>Money handling</li> <li>Service challenges&#x2013;&#x2013;what to do when things go wrong</li> <li>Front-of-the-house safety and sanitation</li> </ul> <p>Industry surveys consistently show that service is the number one reason that people come back to a restaurant&#x2013;or dine elsewhere. With competition increasing for today&#x2019;s dining dollar, restaurants must go beyond culinary excellence to ensure their success. They must offer Remarkable ServiceSM, the kind of service that makes guests feel comfortable, makes dining out enjoyable, and creates customer loyalty.</p> <p>This book offers unique, comprehensive coverage of the principles, standards, and practices that are the hallmark of truly Remarkable ServiceSM. Written by The Culinary Institute of America, which has been hailed by Time magazine as "the nation&#x2019;s most influential training school for cooks," it shares the knowledge and techniques necessary to exceed guest expectations through every part of the dining experience.</p> <p>Remarkable ServiceSM places detailed practical information within the framework of Nine Basic Principles of Hospitality and Service. These critical principles provide the foundation for building an outstanding customer service program in any setting, from informal to fine dining. Filled with invaluable real-life examples and important do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts, this book gives both new and veteran servers&#x2013;and their managers&#x2013;the skills, confidence, and flexibility to bring Remarkable ServiceSM to virtually any situation&#x2013;and keep customers coming back for more.</p>Founded in 1946, The Culinary Institute of America is an independent, not-for-profit college offering bachelor&#x2019;s and associate degrees in culinary arts and baking and pastry arts. Courses for foodservice professionals are offered at the college&#x2019;s main campus in Hyde Park, New York, and at its additional campus for continuing education, The Culinary Institute of America at Greystone, in St. Helena, California.</p><h2>The Normal Christian Life</h2><p>The Normal Christian Life (now available in this new mass-market-size edition) is Watchman Nee&#39;s great Christian classic unfolding the central theme of Christ our Life. Starting from key passages in Romans, Nee reveals the secret of spiritual vitality that should be the normal experience of every Christian. His emphasis on the cross and resurrection of Jesus Christ contains fresh insights that have proven a blessing to many.</p><p>Watchman Nee (1903-1972) was a noted Chinese Bible teacher and Christian leader. He began his preaching ministry while still a university student. From 1923 to 1950 Nee founded 200 churches. Starting as small groups meeting in rented houses, these self-supporting congregations became strong spiritually and grew rapidly, continuing to develop after China&#39;s Cultural Revolution. Nee was arrested on false charges in 1952 and found guilty; he was imprisoned until his death in 1972.</p><h2>Introduction to the Theory of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)</h2><p>Comprehensive coverage of special theory (frames of reference, Lorentz transformation, more), general theory (principle of equivalence, more) and unified theory (Weyl&#39;s gauge-invariant geometry, more.)

Working with a wide range of texts, as well as movies and television, Auerbach locates vampires at the heart of our national experience and uses them as a lens for viewing the last two hundred years of Anglo-American cultural history.<br> <br> "[Auerbach] has seen more Hammer movies than I (or the monsters) have had steaming hot diners, encountered more bloodsuckers than you could shake a stick at, even a pair of crossed sticks, such as might deter a very sophisticated ogre, a hick from the Moldavian boonies....Auerbach has dissected and deconstructed them with the tender ruthlessness of a hungry chef, with cogency and wit."&#x2014;Eric Korn, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br> <br> "This seductive work offers profound insights into many of the urgent concerns of our time and forces us to confront the serious meanings that we invest, and seek, in even the shadiest manifestations of the eroticism of death."&#x2014;Wendy Doniger, <i>The Nation</i><br> <br> "A vigorous, witty look at the undead as cultural icons."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Review</i><br> <br> "In case anyone should think this book is merely a boring lit-crit exposition...Auerbach sets matters straight in her very first paragraph. 'What vampires are in any given generation,' she writes, 'is a part of what I am and what my times have become. This book is a history of Anglo-American culture through its mutating vampires.'...Her book really takes off."&#x2014;Maureen Duffy, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><p>"My central idea: that vampirism springs not only from paranoia, xenophobia, or immortal longings, but from generosity and shared enthusiasm. This strange taste cannot be separated from the expansive impulses that make us human." <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i> is not your ordinary work of literary criticism, but rather an entertaining, thought-provoking tour of the history of vampires in Western civilization. The vampires and works discussed include Lord Ruthven, Varney, Carmilla, Dracula, Fritz Leiber's "The Girl," famous film Draculas, Fred Saberhagen's Dracula, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's Saint-Germain, Anne Rice's Louis and Lestat, Stephen King's Barlow, films such as <i>The Lost Boys</i> and <i>Near Dark,</i> and countless books. As the <i>New York Times</i> writes, "Ms. Auerbach presents her arguments with wit and clarity ... Ms. Auerbach implicitly rejects the Freudian and Jungian interpretations of these figures as either psychosexual metaphors or archetypes, preferring to see them in sociopolitical terms. But such interpretations need not be mutually exclusive. There is, after all, more in vampire metaphors than meets any one mind's eye."Sometimes bewitchingly erotic, sometimes repellent, sometimes ravenous, vampires embody their societies&#39; fears and forbidden dreams. In this wry, original book, literary critic and vampire enthusiast Nina Auerbach shows how every age embraces the vampire it needs and, at the same time, gets the vampire it deserves.</p><h2>Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society</h2><p>White Americans, abetted by neo-conservative writers of all hues, generally believe that racial discrimination is a thing of the past and that any racial inequalities that undeniably persist&#x2015;in wages, family income, access to housing or health care&#x2015;can be attributed to African Americans' cultural and individual failures. If the experience of most black Americans says otherwise, an explanation has been sorely lacking&#x2015;or obscured by the passions the issue provokes. At long last offering a cool, clear, and informed perspective on the subject, this book brings together a team of highly respected sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, and legal scholars to scrutinize the logic and evidence behind the widely held belief in a color-blind society&#x2015;and to provide an alternative explanation for continued racial inequality in the United States. <br><br>While not denying the economic advances of black Americans since the 1960s, <i>Whitewashing Race </i>draws on new and compelling research to demonstrate the persistence of racism and the effects of organized racial advantage across many institutions in American society&#x2015;including the labor market, the welfare state, the criminal justice system, and schools and universities. Looking beyond the stalled debate over current antidiscrimination policies, the authors also put forth a fresh vision for achieving genuine racial equality of opportunity in a post-affirmative action world.</p><p>"In <i>Whitewashing Race,</i> an impressive and diverse group of scholars launch an empirically grounded assault on the vast body of colorblind orthodoxy. The authors harness a medley of disciplinary perspectives into a cogent argument about racial stratification accompanied by a set of practical racial justice policy options. Their aim is both simple and ambitious: to reinvigorate a moribund debate by marshalling their collective intellectual resources to demonstrate that the conservative consensus on race is neither morally sustainable nor logically defensible."&#x2015;Lani Guinier, coauthor of <i>The Miner's Canary: Enlisting Race, Resisting Power, Transforming Democracy</i><br><br>"This powerful book disposes of the claim, so often heard, that America has solved its race problem and can now be 'color-blind.' Based on hard facts, it shows how we must work--for the sake of all of us--to give Black Americans the reality of equal opportunity."&#x2015;Anthony Lewis, author of <i>Gideon's Trumpet</i><br><br>"An essential book. Americans have always worked hard at burying our racial truths, thereby leaving half-truths, myths and raw bigotry to continue their brutal work on our most vulnerable citizens. The authors cauterize these terrible wounds with prodigious research and brilliant insights. Their work is a great service to justice and to our country."&#x2015;Roger Wilkins, author of <i>Jefferson's Pillow: The Founding Fathers and the Dilemma of Black Patriotism</i><br><br>"For many years conservative scholars and think tanks have been trying to convince the American public that racism is dead and that race-specific policies, such as affirmative action, cannot be justified and are in fact detrimental. To a great extent they have succeeded in making ostensible 'color-blindness' the dominant test of law and policy affecting racial minorities. Now at last we have the definitive response to this argument. It comes from seven distinguished scholars from a range of disciplines who believe that race must be taken into account if we are ever to get beyond racism. With massive evidence, much of it quantitative, they blast conservative color-blindness to smithereens, showing that it really functions as a formula to perpetuate racial inequality. No one concerned with racial justice in America can afford to ignore this book."&#x2015;George M. Fredrickson, author of <i>Racism: A Short History</i><br><br>"<i>Whitewashing Race</i> is the most important social science statement on race in more than a decade. It lays bare the expressly conservative, ideological, and deeply flawed analyses of those pundits pressing for 'color-blind' social policy. With lucid prose and truly definitive scholarship, Brown, Wellman, and colleagues thoroughly debunk the reigning conservative consensus. Anyone who cares about racial justice and the fate of the American Dream should read this vitally important book."&#x2015;Lawrence D. Bobo, editor of <i>Prismatic Metropolis: Inequality in Los Angeles</i><br><br>"Far from writing a collection of essays, the authors of <i>Whitewashing Race</i> have collaborated to produce a brilliant, seamless book on America's deepest divide. Framed as a response to conservative analysts who claim that racial problems are essentially solved, the book provides an authoritative overview of how the nation's two principal races still remain sharply apart by every social measure."&#x2015;Andrew Hacker, author of <i>Two Nations: Black and White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal</i><br><br>"In today's political climate, even the most well-meaning liberal tends to believe that institutional racism is a thing of the past and that we've truly achieved a color-blind society. <i>Whitewashing Race</i> makes a powerful case that racism is still with us. Relying on solid evidence rather than polemics, the authors have amassed an overwhelming body of data to show the persistence of racism in the job and housing market, education, the criminal justice system, and the political arena. If we ever have a real 'national conversation' on race, <i>Whitewashing Race</i> ought to be mandatory reading."&#x2015;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams</i><b>Michael K.

It's written for students who seek a connection between science and the world in which they live. How Things Work brings science to the reader rather than the reverse. Like the course in which it developed, this book has always been for nonscientists and is written with their interests in mind. Nonetheless, it has attracted students from the sciences, engineering, architecture, and other technical fields who wish to put scientific concepts into context.<br> <br> This book is written in English and organized in a case-study fashion. It conveys an understanding and appreciation for physics by finding physics concepts and principles within the familiar objects of everyday experience. Because its structure is defined by real-life examples, this book necessarily discusses concepts as they're needed and then revisits them later on when they reappear in other objects.<br> <br> Lou Bloomfield is a highly dedicated teacher and one of the most popular professors at University of Virginia, and was the recipient of the 1998 State of Virginia Outstanding Faculty Award. Lou has given talks all over the country on teaching physics through everyday objects. He has extreme attention to detail and knowledge of technical physics. He is very tech savvy and has been able to provide many of the photos and illustrations for the text himself.</p><p>Uses a unique approach to convey an understanding and appreciation for the concepts and principles of physics and science by finding them within specific objects of everyday experience. Each of the 51 sections tells the story of its object with a minimum of distractions. Every physical notion is held in place by the objects that use it rather than the abstract structure of more traditional physics books. Contains many review questions, historical/biographical vignettes, case studies, exercises and simple experiments.Though his moves appear magical, this skateboarder is performing his stunts entirely within the laws of physics. More importantly, he is making those laws real and relevant. This book is all about putting the laws of physics in context. By finding physics in the objects of everyday experience, How Things Work transforms the field from a remote and abstract academic discipline into the essential basis for understanding our world and everything in it. <p>Our skateboarder illustrates the same physics we'll explore in the first two chapters of this book. Like someone who is skating (Section 1.1), he spends much of his time coasting forward because of his own inertia. But his recent trip up a ramp (Section 1.3) has lifted him high above the ground so that he is subject only to his weight-the downward pull of gravity-and travels in the arc of a falling ball (Section 1.2).</p> <p>Of course, since both he and the board rotate like seesaws (Section 2.1) as they fall, landing safely is more than half the challenge. His concentration is a sure sign that he intends to ride the skateboard back down the slope on its friction-reducing wheels (Section 2.2) in another second or two. However, if he makes a mistake and collides with something, as he would in a bumper car(Section 2.3), it's Reassuring to note that he's warning a helmet.</p> <p>If this all sounds rather ordinary, it's because physics is ordinary. It's everywhere you look. But understanding physics well will require some guidance and thought, so it's time to venture inside this book.</p></p><h2>Modern Russian Tanks &amp; AFVs: 1990-Present (Technical Guides)</h2><p><b>A colorful guide to the most significant Russian tanks deployed since 1990.</b><br><br> Created from what was left of the gigantic stockpiles of Soviet armored fighting vehicles after the end of the Cold War, the Russian armored forces were reorganized in the early 1990s. <i>Modern Russian Tanks &amp; AFVs</i> explores the main battle tanks, armored fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, self- propelled guns, and missile-launching platforms in service since then, when ground forces engaged in a series of conflicts in border states from Chechnya to the Crimea to the Ukraine.

The authors argue that the tendency toward administrative evil, as manifested in acts of dehumanization and genocide, is deeply woven into the identity of public affairs. The common characteristic of administrative evil is that ordinary people within their normal professional and administrative roles can engage in acts of evil without being aware that they are doing anything wrong. Under conditions of moral inversion, people may even view their evil activity as good. In the face of what is now a clear and present danger in the United States, this book seeks to lay the groundwork for a more ethical and democratic public life; one that recognizes its potential for evil, and thereby creates greater possibilities for avoiding the hidden pathways that lead to state-sponsored dehumanization and destruction. What's new in the Fourth Edition of&nbsp;<em>Unmasking Administrative Evil</em>:</p> <ul> <li>UAE is updated and revised with new scholarship on administrative ethics, evil, and contemporary politics.</li> <li>The authors include new cases on the dangers of market-based governance, contracting out, and deregulation.</li> <li>There is an enhanced focus on the potential for administrative evil in the private sector.</li> <li>The authors have written a new Afterword on administrative approaches to the aftermath of evil, with the potential for expiation, healing, and reparations.</li></ul></p><p><p><strong>Guy B. Adams</strong> is Professor Emeritus in the Harry S. Truman School of Public Affairs at the University of Missouri, USA.</p> <p><strong>Danny L. Balfour</strong> is Professor in the School of Public and Nonprofit Administration and a faculty fellow of the Honors College at Grand Valley State University, USA.</p><p><strong>"Broad ranging in its scholarship, this book offers insights about how to think organizationally as well as individually about ethics and the ever-present possibility of evil manifesting itself in public life. Guy Adams and Danny Balfour throw new light on numerous examples of administrative evil, from the administration of the Holocaust in Nazi Germany to the post-war U.S. space program and the development of a bureaucratic culture that contributed to the <i>Challenger</i> explosion."</strong> -- <i>Bruce Jennings, Director of Bioethics, Center for Humans &amp; Nature</i></p> <p><strong>"This is not a safe nor a comfortable book, but it is a difficult one to ignore or neglect. The authors provide nothing less than moral and intellectual coherence for a series of powerful, but disparate, critiques of the field of public administration. They accomplish this feat with vivid writing and great economy, while also leading the reader to grapple with a credible alternative approach to today's dominant models of how government does and should work."</strong> -- <i>William M. Sullivan, Wabash College</i></p> <p><strong>"<i>Unmasking Administrative Evil</i> is a troubling book, but a very important one that is essential reading. Using the Holocaust as "the signal event in human history that unmasks the reality of administrative evil," the authors illuminate the very real problem of how contemporary administrative arrangements can and do mask evil. Guy Adams and Danny Balfour are to be congratulated for this pathbreaking, fascinating, highly readable, and convincing study. We will all be much better off if the public administration community takes it to heart."</strong> -- <i>David H. Rosenbloom, American University</i></p> <p><strong>"Adams and Balfour have proved a well-crafted study on the 'other side' of administrative ethics. Scholars have been so preoccupied with trying to understand what 'good' we are trying to motivate that we have often forgotten what evil we are trying to prevent. Looking at the underside of ethics, the authors provide us with a far richer and more meaningful understanding of why the study of public administration ethics is so important."</strong> -- <i>Stuart C. Gilman, Global Integrity Group</i></p></p><h2>An Illustrated Guide to Theoretical Ecology</h2><p><em>An Illustrated Guide to Theoretical Ecology</em> uses a combination of visual presentations and the symbolic logic of algebra and calculus to provide the most accessible introduction to ecological theory available. It gives students the basic tools they need to understand the complexities of ecological systems and to analyze simple quantitative ecological problems. The author walks students through the most common models in ecology, beginning with first principles and then gently making each formulation accessible through a step-by-step development of equations paired with lavish illustrations. He also applies theoretical developments to practical issues in conservation and resource management, offering a more visceral understanding of the purpose and utility of the theory and demonstrating how it may need modification in its application to real-world problems and future directions. The text also includes some basic ecological genetics and an exploration of metapopulation dynamics. <br> <em>An Illustrated Guide to Theoretical Ecology</em> is enhanced by over 500 two-color diagrams, many end-of-chapter problems, and a website that includes simulation models that parallel each chapters development (http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/BookCase). Ideal as a main text for advanced undergraduate courses in theoretical and mathematical ecology or conservation biology, this unique book can also serve as a supplement or a self-guided tutorial in general ecology, population ecology, and community ecology courses.<br></p><p>Ted J. Case is at University of California, San Diego."Really an excellent text; it supplies a thorough, biology-based introduction to ecological theory. I expect it will prove very useful for my course in population ecology for natural resource management students. The authors' explicit use of multiple modes of learning is refreshing."--Mark C.<br>Andersen, New Mexico State University<br><br>"A terrific resource. It is all the basic mathematical underpinnings of ecology that I spend hours trying to explain to students at all levels--explained better than I do it--PLUS the things that I have to review myself before opening my mouth on theoretical issues. Two levels of excellent<br>diagrams give rigourous heuristic justifications for the algebraic formalism. I'm also recommending this highly to my colleagues as a supplement for all undergraduate coursees that even touch on theory, and as a main text for any heavily theoretical course."--Henry S. Horn, Princeton<br>University<br><br>"For many students of ecology, the more mathematical aspects of ecology theory are difficult, if not impossible, to penetrate. This book offers the best effort that I have seen to help remedy this situation. This is an attractive, large format book and, as the title suggests, is generously<br>furnished with illustrations. The real strength is in the meticulous care with which Case covers virtually every important topic across a broad array of theoretical ecology, from single species to multispecies communities. The elements of demography are covered in great detail, but, at the same<br>time, more advanced ideas, such as the effects of temporal and individual variability on population growth rate and probability of extinction, are woven into the text in a way that make them just as natural and easy to grasp." -- Donald DeAngelis, BioScience, Sept 2000, Vol. 50, No. 9</p><h2>The First Amendment (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p>From the same authorship team behind the highly successful Constitutional Law and among the leading casebooks in the field, The First Amendment provides a comprehensive and accessible review of speech and religion jurisprudence under the First Amendment.

This groundbreaking book sets out a comprehensive, integrated theory of why and how the human mind has developed to function as it does. Geary proposes that human motivational, affective, behavioral, and cognitive systems have evolved to process social and ecological information (e.g., facial expressions) that covaried with survival or reproductive options during human evolution. Further, he argues that the ultimate focus of all of these systems is to support our attempts to gain access to and control of resources - more specifically, the social (e.g., mates), biological (e.g., food), and physical (e.g., territory) resources that supported successful survival and reproduction over time. In this view, Darwin&#39;s conceptualization of natural selection as a struggle for existence becomes, for us, a struggle with other human beings for control of the available resources. This struggle provides a means of integrating modular brain and cognitive systems such as language with those brain and cognitive systems that support general intelligence. findings in cognitive science and neuroscience as well as primatology, anthropology, and sociology. The book also explores a number of issues that are of interest in modern society, including how general intelligence relates to academic achievement, occupational status, and income. Readers will find this book a thought-provoking read and an impetus for new theories of mind.</p><p></p><h2>The Priestly Bride</h2><p>Christ is coming back for a bride that is totally in love with Him, devoted to Him and about the business of pursuing Him.

Published in 1967, the book now has an updated bibliography and a new preface by Liberty, in which she shares her recollections of Stands in Timber and describes the circumstances of the Cheyenne over the past thirty years.<br><br>Stands in Timber was born in 1882, a few years after his grandfather was killed in the Custer battle. In this book he recounts tribal myths and sacred rituals, conflict with traditional enemies and whites, and&nbsp; eventual &#x201c;civilization&#x201d; and settlement on a reservation. The retelling of Cheyenne traditions formed an important part of Stands in Timber&#x2019;s life from early childhood, and on his return from school in 1905 he became the primary keeper of the oral literature of his people, seeking out every elder who could contribute personal memories to Cheyenne lore. In 1956 he met Margot Liberty, then an Indian Affairs&nbsp; Bureau teacher, who helped him tape-record more than thirty hours of recollections. From these she compiled this unique and lively folk history, one based on a longtime inside view that can never be duplicated.<br><br>&#x201c;This is an extraordinarily fascinating book,&nbsp; . . . a book that all Americans, Indians as well as non-Indians, will treasure.&#x201d;&#x2015;Alvin M.

Science writer Jim Robbins suggests that some such conditions--like epilepsy, autism, and depression--could yield to a recently developed technique called neurofeedback. His book <i>A Symphony in the Brain</i> describes the process, its evolution from the 1970s fad of biofeedback, its practitioners, and some of its success stories. Using computers to quickly provide information on real-time EEG, practitioners train patients to control global or local brain states--or so the theory goes. Unfortunately for its proponents, there are still no rigorous research data showing conclusive results. Robbins makes a good case that the lack of research is due more to scientific turf battles and a drug-dependent medical establishment than to any fault of neurofeedback. Some of the case studies he explores, of children and adults brought out of comas or trained to reduce their epileptic seizure frequency, suggest that we ought to look more deeply and rigorously into the technique. Whether it works can only be determined by controlled studies, which may be forthcoming. In the meantime, Robbins provides contact lists and additional research information for interested readers, as well as the inspiration to pursue a potentially life-saving treatment. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>For over thirty years, Victor Bevine has worked as an actor, screenwriter, audio book narrator, director, and more.

Like those earlier books, the frequently hilarious <i>A Tramp Abroad</i> (1880)-based on his family's 16-month sojourn in Europe from April 1878 to August 1879-blends autobiography and fiction, facts and tall tales. Twain's send-up of Old World customs as well as his critical dissections of Wagnerian opera and the German language are often interlaced with American reminiscences, whether in the form of an extended discourse on the language of blue jays or the recollection of an elaborate practical joke in Hannibal, Missouri, involving a printer's devil and a skeleton. <i>A Tramp Abroad</i> is presented here with the author's original sketches. <br><br> Written at a time of financial trouble and personal loss (the death of the author's beloved daughter Susy), <i>Following the Equator</i> (1897) is a darker and more politicized account of a lecture tour around the world, with Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Ceylon, India, Mauritius, and South Africa among the stop�overs. Using humorous but often biting anecdotes as well as keen journalist reporting, the book details bush life in Australia and the culture of the Maoris in New Zealand, while lashing out at social inequities such as the Indian caste system, and racist imperialism connected with European settlement and gold mining in southern Africa. Twain rounds out the volume with extensive historical accounts ranging from the Black Hole of Calcutta to the events in South Africa that would lead shortly to the Boer War. <br><br> This volume also includes 13 shorter pieces, most of them uncollected by the author, including a lengthy firsthand narrative of the shah of Persia's 1873 visit to London, an 1891 description of Richard Wagner's operas performed at Bayreuth, an 1897 account of Queen Victoria's jubilee in London, and an 1898 analysis of vitriolic Austrian parliamentary proceedings. The texts of several of these "other travels" are presented in newly corrected and fully restored versions. <br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

In his person and in his pursuits he was a man of extraordinary contrasts. Although he left school at twelve when his father died, he was eventually awarded honorary degrees from Yale University, the University of Missouri, and Oxford University. His career encompassed such varied occupations as printer, Mississippi riverboat pilot, journalist, travel writer, and publisher. He made fortunes from his writing but toward the end of his life he had to resort to lecture tours to pay his debts. He was hot-tempered, profane, and sentimental<b> </b>and also pessimistic, cynical, and tortured by self-doubt. His nostalgia helped produce some of his best books. He lives in American letters as a great artist, the writer whom William Dean Howells called &#x201c;the Lincoln of our literature.&#x201d;"An encompassing and essential voyage to the dark side of the moon of American literature." -- Jonathan Lethem<br><br>"Hoo-ahh.

The book&#x2019;s scope, as the title implies, is the whole story of humanity, in planetary context. Its themes include not only the great questions of the humanities&#x2014;nature versus nurture, the history and meaning of human variation, the sources of wealth and causes of revolution&#x2014;but also the major transformations in human history: agriculture, cities, iron, writing, universal religions, global trade, industrialization, popular government, justice, and equality. <br><br>In each conceptually rich chapter, Kevin Reilly concentrates on a single important period and theme, sustaining a focused narrative and analytical perspective. Free of either a confined, limiting focus or a mandatory laundry list of topics, this book begins with our most important questions and searches all of our past for answers. Well-grounded in the latest scholarship, this is not a fill-in-the-blanks text, but world history in a grand humanistic tradition. <br><br>An instructor&#x2019;s manual includes questions for classroom discussion, substance exam questions, evaluative questions, critical thinking questions, and multiple choice questions, also available in a test-bank format.<br><br>.</p><p>Kevin Reilly is professor of history at Raritan Valley College.

Kevin Reilly presents stories of humanity's past that are concise while also providing depth and ease of understanding. This is an engaging text where readers travel back in time and are amply rewarded for their journey.--David M. Kalivas, Middlesex Community College; editor of H-World at H-Net<br><br>Kevin Reilly has been a pioneer in the field of world history for three decades. His textbooks and source collections have brought order and clarity to this vast subject for a generation of college students.

I can think of no better place to start out on the path of world history.--George D. Sussman, LaGuardia Community College, CUNY<br><br>Up-to-date information and conceptualization take this book to a new level of excellence. As always, Kevin Reilly offers rich social history and narrative.--Marilynn Hitchens, University of Colorado Denver<br><br>This is a wonderfully scholarly book that directly engages the latest debates in the field (with footnotes even!) yet wears its erudition lightly. Reilly expertly weaves together political, economic, social, and LOTS of cultural threads, selecting good--and sometimes surprising--case studies for illustration. The text never loses sight of his view of the grand arc of it all, arguing for a series of successive globalizations over at least the last millennium. This text will make a wonderful companion to Reilly's two-volume document series, which remains a classic in the field.--Sue Gronewold, Kean University</p><h2>The Hollow Man (Classic Crime S.)</h2><p>The most famous of all locked-room mysteries - a classic in the crime genre.&#39;The first deadly walking of the hollow man took place when the side streets of London were quiet with snow and the three coffins of the prophecy were filled at last...&#39;The murderer of Dr Grimauld walked through a locked door, shot his victim and vanished. He killed his second victim in the middle of an empty street, with watchers at each end, yet nobody saw him, and he left no footprints in the snow.And so it is up to the irrepressible, larger-than-life Dr Gideon Fell to solve this most famous and taxing of locked-room mysteries.</p><p>John Dickson Carr (1906-1977), the master of the locked-room mystery, was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, the son of a US Congressman. He studied law in Paris before settling in England where he married an Englishwoman, and he spent most of his writing career living in Great Britain. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Golden Age mystery writers, his work featured apparently impossible crimes often with seemingly supernatural elements. He modelled his affable and eccentric series detective Gideon Fell on G. K. Chesterton, and wrote a number of novels and short stories, including his series featuring Henry Merrivale, under the pseudonym Carter Dickson. He was one of only two Americans admitted to the British Detection club, and was highly praised by other mystery writers. Dorothy L. Sayers said of him that &#39;he can create atmosphere with an adjective, alarm with allusion, or delight with a rollicking absurdity&#39;. In 1950 he was awarded the first of two prestigious Edgar Awards by the Mystery Writers of America, and was presented with their Grand Master Award in 1963. He died in Greenville, South Carolina in 1977.Carr&#39;s 1935 locked door mystery still rivals any present day crime novel and its status as a textbook for writers in the genre means it is a necessary read * BIG ISSUE IN THE NORTH * John Dickson Carr was a master of the locked room mystery. In The Hollow Man, one of his earliest novels, written when he was just 29, a murder takes place in circumstances that make it seem impossible for the killer to have escaped undetected. ...

But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn't live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television. </p><p>When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.

TEACHING ESSENTIAL DISCRIMINATION SKILLS TO CHILDREN WITH AUTISM outlines a systematic, evidence-based curriculum to promote children's learning. Based on the authors' thirty years of research, the user-friendly text and illustrative case studies cover:<br> -Delivering effective instruction (repeat trials, brisk pacing, child's active participation, reinforcement)<br> -Types of discrimination skills (understanding differences, matching like to like, matching words to objects, following spoken-word instructions)<br> -Prompting and prompt fading<br> -Prerequisite skills (imitation, readiness to learn)<br> -Overcoming barriers to learning (lack of scanning, low motivation)<br> -Assessing a child's entry level to the curriculum<br> -Curriculum sequence, specific discrimination skills instruction, and remedial strategies <p></p> <p> Parents and educators can use this book to teach the foundational discrimination skills that help children become more proficient and independent in a variety of ways, such as using picture activity schedules and augmentative and alternative communication systems, mastering more complex academic skills, and applying learning across many situations in their daily lives.</p></p><p>Rebecca MacDonald is a Licensed Psychologist in Massachusetts and a Board Certified Behavior Analyst who serves as the Director of Intensive Instructional Preschool Program for children with autism at the New England Center for Children. Susan Langer, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, serves as the Chief Program Officer at the New England Center for Children. Both authors are researchers and teach graduate level courses at universities in Massachusetts.This book outlines a cumulative and hierarchical sequence of lessons, including an assessment. From recognizing sounds and objects, to understanding the meaning of words and other symbols, discrimination learning is of utmost importance during the development of both verbal and nonverbal behaviors. It is also a component of every single lesson aimed at teaching academic, social, and at teaching academic, social, and cognitive skills to children with autism, whether using discrete trial or incidental teaching. This how-to discrimination curriculum is a welcome addition to the early intensive behavioral intervention literature, and should be a required reading for those in the fields of education, speech and language pathology, and applied behavior analysis. --Caio F.

A combination of instruction and exercises shows them how to use critical thinking to more fully&nbsp;appreciate the power of the discipline they are studying, to see its connections to other fields and to their day-to-day lives, to maintain an overview of the field so they can see the parts in terms of the whole, and to become <i>active learners</i> rather than passive recipients of information. The model of critical thinking (used throughout the book) is in terms of the elements of reasoning, standards, and critical thinking processes. This model is&nbsp;well-suited&nbsp;to thinking through any problem or question.</p><p>To the Instructor <p> This book is intended as a guidebook for learning to think critically in a discipline, a subject matter, an area, or a field of study. I use these terms more or less interchangeably throughout the book. It applies to disciplines taught at any level of generality, at any educational level. This includes courses in humanities, social and natural sciences, business, arts, nursing, international studies, and so on. It includes multidisciplinary courses, but it is in no way confined to them. </p><p> I specifically mean to include courses that emphasize doing as well as understanding: composition courses stand out in particular. (There are exercises suitable for student writing, and the text promotes full integration of the composition course with other courses students are taking, across the curriculum.) But the book applies to any discipline that emphasizes mindful doing: physical education, nursing, business, math, veterinary science, agriculture, foreign languages. (In fact, in the purest sense, all courses emphasize doing: learning physics is learning to do physics. Learning physics is learning how to actively think one's way through the physical world.) </p><p> Although this book was not written to be the main text in a course specifically in critical thinking, I have used it that way in my own courses, and many teachers of critical thinking have used Richard Paul's model in their courses. </p><p> In my critical-thinking courses, I have asked my students to use the model to analyze and evaluate newspaper editorials; to apply it to problems in their personal lives; to analyze their relationships with other people; to analyze, compare, and evaluate news sources and advertising; to evaluate their own study skills; to think through art works and a wide variety of other topics. Several times I have taught my critical-thinking course where the only other texts required were the .texts from other courses the student was taking. There, the goal was to help the students learn to think through the disciplines or subject matter they were studying in those other courses. What permits this diversity is the great flexibility of Paul's model of critical thinking. </p><p> This book is a guide to critical thinking across the curriculum and is intended to be inexpensive, so that it can be used economically as an adjunct text in a course. I have tried to keep it short enough so that students can be required to read it all the way through near the beginning of the semester. That way they can refer back to it again and again, applying specific critical-thinking concepts to different parts of the subject matter as the course moves along, gradually coming to integrate those parts. Learning to Think Things Through works best, I believe, when used in a course that has another text. In most cases, that will be the main required book for the course, but it needn't be. The "text" can consist of readings brought in by the teacher or by the students. It can be video or audio material of any sort. It can include chapters, specific problems, case studies, primary sources, journal articles, virtually any outside material. Many questions in this book direct students to apply critical-thinking concepts to the texts in the course. </p><p> Many teachers in a field or discipline want their students to learn to think critically about the subject matter they are studying, and to learn to think about the world in terms of that subject matter. They want their students not to be passive recipients of information absorbed from the teacher or the text. Rather, teachers want their students to become active learners who pay attention to crucial elements of reasoning, such as assumptions, purposes, implications and consequences, and who do this in a way that meets high intellectual standards. This book is intended to help accomplish those goals. Using Learning to Think Things Through in a Course </p><p> This book can be used by teachers in a range of ways. The way of using the text that I favor is as a highly integrated part of the course as a whole. The goal, again, is to keep students actively thinking their way through the course and the subject matter, rather than sinking back into being passive recipients. </p><p> As the teacher, I can have them identify key concepts of the discipline for each chapter, unit, lesson, lecture, and presentation. I can have them construct applications of the concepts from their own experience, integrate the concepts, and draw up concept maps. Students can be given frequent practice at formulating key questions, finding relevant information, evaluating its significance, and searching for alternatives. I can have the students analyze readings or important course material right from the beginning of the course. </p><p> In addition to giving students ongoing practice at thinking critically within the discipline, activities like these furnish the teacher with valuable insight into where exactly their students are in the course. These activities can be done in group work or individually, in class or as homework assignments, in written or oral form, with or without specific feedback from the teacher. Activities like these, and many others, are identified in Learning to Think Things Through, and there are exercises on such thinking activities at the end of each chapter. </p><p> There are any number of other ways this book can be used in courses. Teachers can have students work through the book on their own. Assigning exercises at the end of each chapter (some of which have suggested answers) can significantly help students in their critical thinking with minimal input from the instructor. </p><p> Many teachers find it valuable to devote some class time to helping students learn how to assess their own work and the work of fellow students, giving one another critical feedback on the thinking. The elements (Chapter 3) and standards (Chapter 4) are an ideal vehicle for this. Devoting this class time, even though it might seem at first glance to cut down on the amount of time devoted to teaching the discipline, allows teachers to give frequent short written assignments throughout the semester (shown to be highly effective in helping students retain and internalize the discipline) and to make sure students receive at least some feedback on them. It does this without increasing the amount of valuable time the teacher spends on reading and correcting student assignments. The brunt of learning is placed where it ought to be, as a responsibility of the students themselves. Teachers are freer to become the resource and the facilitator of learning that they really are. </p><p> The elements, standards, and subject-matter concepts make this task of self-assessment focused and beneficial both for the student being assessed and the student doing the assessing. Both are engaged in doing critical thinking about the subject matter. This book contains exercises specifically on this, and many more can be readily constructed using the elements and standards. </p><p> Consider a simple example. One of the elements is purpose, and one of the standards is clearness. In my courses, I give frequent written assignments. For each of them, I ask students to write down at the top what, in their best judgment, is the purpose of the assignment. This in and of itself helps students to focus their thinking (and to be aware that the assignments in fact have a purpose&#x2014;that is sometimes a surprise!). Then I ask students, in pairs or in groups of four, to assess how clearly each statement of purpose was written. That gives students specific critical thinking feedback on an important standard, and the clarity of their responses almost invariably improves. Similar feedback can be given from student to student about any of the elements and any of the standards. </p><p> One further note on using Learning to Think Things Through: the model presented here is a highly integrated model, and there is great benefit in having students read the entire book near the beginning of the course, rather than piecing it out as the course progresses. The flexibility and comprehensiveness of the model are not as available to students when they learn one part at a time and then try to get a sense of the whole. After getting a sense of the whole, students can then work on those aspects that give them difficulty. The Model </p><p> This book is built on Richard Paul's model of critical thinking. I wrote Learning to Think Things Through because there is no short, connected presentation of this model suitable for use in a subject-matter course. Essential parts of it are set forth in Paul's Critical Thinking: What Every Person Needs to Survive in a Rapidly Changing World and in Critical Thinking: Basic Theory and Instructional Structures. The model is the one Paul, Linda Elder, 1, and a number of other workshop facilitators at the Center for Critical Thinking have used in workshops and academies over the years. </p><p> The model has quantitative empirical backing. Jennifer Reed, in her doctoral dissertation, tested Paul's model in history classes at the community college level. It fared well not just compared to a didactic course in history, but compared to an alternative model of critical thinking where the key concepts were taught implicitly rather than explicitly (with no significant differences in knowledge of history content). </p><p> Two parts of this model form the core of this book.</p><p>Elements of Reasoning. These are the central concepts of reasoning itself. Paul often describes them as the "parts" of thinking. When I reason through something, I may be trying to do any number of things: I may be trying to see the implications of holding a certain point of view, for example, or I may be trying to come to some conclusion, based on certain assumptions I start out with. I may be deciding that I need more information to decide this question at issue. I may simply wonder what my purpose is in a certain venture, and what alternatives there are. All of these, and many others, are examples of trying to reason through something. The elements of reasoning are an attempt to extract the common concepts from this virtually unlimited set of reasoning activities. Thus, to learn to reason is to come to mastery of concepts like implications, point of view, conclusions, assumptions, information, question at issue, and purpose. Concepts like these are elements of reasoning. Chapter 3 is devoted to the elements. Standards of Critical Thinking. It can be seriously misleading to say that critical thinking is learning how to think. Critical thinking is learning how to think well. It is thinking that meets high standards of quality. Again, there are many ways I can think through something well. I can figure out that one conclusion is more accurate than another. I can see implications more clearly than I saw them before. I can focus on the most important aspects of a problem. I can realize that I've thought through an issue sufficiently, and that now it is time to act. The standards are an attempt to formulate the heart of what constitutes the quality component in critical thinking. Like the elements, the standards are a set of concepts. I think through an issue well when I think it through accurately and clearly, when I focus on what is most important to deciding the issue, when I think it through sufficiently. To learn to reason well is to come to mastery not only of the elements, but also of standards like accuracy, clearness, importance, and sufficiency. Concepts like these are standards of critical thinking. Chapter 4 is devoted to the standards. </p><p> The general injunction, then, in Paul's model, is this: </p><p> Take any problem, in any area, and think it out using the elements of reasoning and the standards of reasoning.</p><p></p><p> Developing a greater ability to think in terms of the elements and standards promotes a flexibility that is ideally useful, and maximally transferable, in teaching for critical thinking in subject-matter courses across the curriculum. </p><p> In Learning to Think Things Through, both elements and standards are applied to thinking within the discipline. Part of this, in any field, is learning to think the way someone in that discipline thinks. That means being able to think in terms of specific systems that are taught in the discipline (Chapter 5). More than that, it means being able to think in terms of those central concepts and questions that lie at the heart of the discipline. These are described in Chapter 2. </p><p> My presentation of Paul's model differs from his in a few important respects. I have added context and alternatives to his eight elements. I have also omitted part of Paul's model. For example, because of space limitations, I have reluctantly omitted discussion of the extremely valuable intellectual traits, such as intellectual courage and intellectual humility. Putting It All Together </p><p> A general picture is presented in Chapter 5. It is a picture of the core process of critical thinking, of answering critical-thinking questions in the subject matter. It is tagged by the acronym QEDS. You begin by looking critically at the question being asked (Q). You think it through using the elements (E) and the central concepts and questions of the discipline (D). You assess and revise your thinking using the standards (S). </p><p> This core process, common to all areas of thinking, is what makes critical thinking transferable. By internalizing it in your course, students can learn to think more effectively in other courses, in the interconnections between disciplines, and in their lives as related to the disciplines. To the Student </p><p> The aim of this book is to help you improve your critical thinking within the subject matter of the courses you are taking. A secondary goal, a byproduct of the first, is to help you improve your ability to think effectively in your life as a whole. The way you use this book is likely to be different from the way you use most books in courses. </p><p> First, this isn't a book you can just read through. You can't get better at critical thinking merely by reading about critical thinking&#x2014;not even if you're a very good reader. You have to do it. You have to take problems or questions the text asks and actually think them out as you work your way through the book. At least some of them: In addition, it helps if you can get feedback on your thinking. You have to do this again and again. </p><p> That's because what the book teaches is not a body of information. If the book is successful for you, you will be learning to do something. That requires more than just learning information, more than just learning skills. It is not just about how to think critically&#x2014;it is about actually thinking critically. </p><p> Learning to do something cannot be accomplished just by reading about it. You can't get thinner merely by reading about dieting; your basketball or dancing won't improve merely by hearing about how to dance or shoot free throws. Your writing won't improve merely by learning that you have to consider your audience&#x2014;you actually have to consider your audience. To improve the way you do something, it takes both instruction (in this case, reading the book, receiving feedback) and practice (doing it). </p><p> Second, depending on what your instructor says, you may need to read the book all the way through right near th...</p><p>Do your students really understand a chapter after they have read it? Can they accurately tell its purpose, the main questions it raises, and the conclusions it draws? For teachers who want their students to <b>learn to think more critically</b>, one question dominates: How can I teach critical thinking within my subject matter?&nbsp; <i>Learning to Think Things Through: A Guide to Critical Thinking Across the Curriculum</i> provides the answers to these and many more questions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The main goal of the text is to show how critical thinking can help students comprehend any subject so they can see the parts in terms of the whole, to <b>become active learners</b> rather than passive recipients of information. <i>Learning to Think Things Through</i> gives students a written guide to critical thinking that is clear, short, inexpensive, accessible, and shows readers how to think through any problem or question.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"This text stacks up very well against its competition because it is concise.&nbsp; The difficulty in choosing texts on critical thinking is that they are either too complicated, do not offer enough coverage, or use a particular discipline to explicate critical thinking.&nbsp; What makes this text effective is that it is easy to work with and applicable to any and all disciplines."</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Susan Quarrell, Lehman College</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><b> <p>Additional Support -- in and out of the classroom. . .</p> </b><p><b></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Visit the Student Success Supersite (www.prenhall.com/success), where students and faculty will find an array of resources.<b></b></p></p><h2>Foundations of Astronomy</h2><p>With this newly revised Twelfth Edition of FOUNDATIONS OF ASTRONOMY, the authors&#39; goals are to help you use astronomy to understand science--and use science to understand what we are.

Since that time many artist have attempted to capture their dreamlike combination of impossible events, precise detail and weird logic. Mervyn Peake is on of the few to have succeeded. Famed worldwide for his Gormenghast trilogy, Mervyn Peake was also an illustrator of rare and wondrous talent, whose editions of Treasure Island and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner are universally admired. In the 1940s he was commissioned to produce a set of 70 pen-and-ink drawings to accompany Lewis Carroll&#39;s two classics, Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. They are among his best work as an illustrator. Unavailable in any edition since 1978, these extraordinary illustrations, many of which were drawn on poor quality wartime paper, have been restored to their former clarity and crispness by a combination of old-fashioned craft and the latest computer technology. They are now meticulously reproduced, for the first time, as they were meant to be seen. This exquisite two-volume set is the first edition to do justice to two great English eccentrics.</p><p><blockquote> <i>"And what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"</i> </blockquote><p> Taking to heart his charming, insatiably curious heroine's words, Lewis Carroll worked many long hours (days, months...) with illustrator Sir John Tenniel to create the most perfect pictures imaginable for what were to become instant classics: <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>. When thinking about Alice and her dreamy surrealistic adventures down the rabbit hole and behind the looking-glass, who can help picturing the golden-haired girl in her lilac dress and striped stockings, gazing up at the Cheshire Cat or arguing with Tweedledum and Tweedledee? Tenniel's drawings remained black and white for over 40 years until 1911, when eight prints in each book were hand colored. Now, for the first time, every remaining illustration has been colored, making these the first editions to feature all of the original art in full color. Traditionalists need not worry: colorist Diz Wallis colored proofs taken from Tenniel's carefully preserved woodblocks, remaining faithful to his original drawings. The beautiful tones of these new hardcover editions look as natural as can be; they could just as easily be from the 19th century.

Coverage begins with the more general nonparametric point of view and then looks at parametric models as submodels of the nonparametric ones which can be described smoothly by Euclidean parameters. Although some computational issues are discussed, this is very much a book on theory. It relates theory to conceptual and technical issues encountered in practice, viewing theory as suggestive for practice, not prescriptive. It shows readers how assumptions which lead to neat theory may be unrealistic in practice. <b></b> Statistical Models, Goals, and Performance Criteria. Methods of Estimation.

These techniques often have a strong intrinsic computational component. Tomographic data are the result of mathematically based processing. Sequencing is done by applying computational algorithms to raw gel electrophoresis data. </p><p> As a consequence the emphasis of statistical theory has shifted away from the small sample optimality results that were a major theme of our book in a number of directions:</p><p>Methods for inference based on larger numbers of observations and minimal assumptions&#x2014;asymptotic methods in non- and semiparametric models, models with "infinite" number of parameters.<br><br> The construction of models for time series, temporal spatial series, and other complex data structures using sophisticated probability modeling but again relying for analytical results on asymptotic approximation. Multiparameter models are the rule.<br><br> The use of methods of inference involving simulation as a key element such as the bootstrap and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.<br><br> The development of techniques not describable in "closed mathematical form" but rather through elaborate algorithms for which problems of existence of solutions are important and far from obvious.<br><br> The study of the interplay between numerical and statistical considerations. Despite advances in computing speed, some methods run quickly in real time. Others do not and some though theoretically attractive cannot be implemented in a human lifetime.<br><br> The study of the interplay between the number of observations and the number of parameters of a model and the beginnings of appropriate asymptotic theories.<br> </p><p> There have, of course, been other important consequences such as the extensive development of graphical and other exploratory methods for which theoretical development and connection with mathematics have been minimal. These will not be dealt with in our work. </p><p> As a consequence our second edition, reflecting what we now teach our graduate students, is much changed from the first. Our one long book has grown to two volumes, each to be only a little shorter than the first edition. </p><p> Volume I, which we present in 2000, covers material we now view as important for all beginning graduate students in statistics and science and engineering graduate students whose research will involve statistics intrinsically rather than as an aid in drawing conclusions. </p><p> In this edition we pursue our philosophy of describing the basic concepts of mathematical statistics relating theory to practice. However, our focus and order of presentation have changed. </p><p> Volume I covers the material of Chapters 1-6 and Chapter 10 of the first edition with pieces of Chapters 7-10 and includes Appendix A on basic probability theory. However, Chapter 1 now has become part of a larger Appendix B, which includes more advanced topics from probability theory such as the multivariate Gaussian distribution, weak convergence in Euclidean spaces, and probability inequalities as well as more advanced topics in matrix theory and analysis. The latter include the principal axis and spectral theorems for Euclidean space and the elementary theory of convex functions on Rd as well as an elementary introduction to Hilbert space theory. As in the first edition, we do not require measure theory but assume from the start that our models are what we call "regular." That is, we assume either a discrete probability whose support does not depend on the parameter set, or the absolutely continuous case with a density. Hilbert space theory is not needed, but for those who know this topic Appendix B points out interesting connections to prediction and linear regression analysis. </p><p> Appendix B is as self-contained as possible with proofs of most statements, problems, and references to the literature for proofs of the deepest results such as the spectral theorem. The reason for these additions are the changes in subject matter necessitated by the current areas of importance in the field. </p><p> Specifically, instead of beginning with parametrized models we include from the start non- and semiparametric models, then go to parameters and parametric models stressing the role of identifiability. From the beginning we stress function-valued parameters, such as the density, and function-valued statistics, such as the empirical distribution function. We also, from the start, include examples that are important in applications, such as regression experiments. There is more material on Bayesian models and analysis. Save for these changes of emphasis the other major new elements of Chapter 1, which parallels Chapter 2 of the first edition, are an extended discussion of prediction and an expanded introduction to k-parameter exponential families. These objects that are the building blocks of most modern models require concepts involving moments of random vectors and convexity that are given in Appendix B. </p><p> Chapter 2 of this edition parallels Chapter 3 of the first and deals with estimation. Major differences here are a greatly expanded treatment of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), including a complete study of MLEs in canonical k-parameter exponential families. Other novel features of this chapter include a detailed analysis including proofs of convergence of a standard but slow algorithm for computing MLEs in multiparameter exponential families and an introduction to the EM algorithm, one of the main ingredients of most modern algorithms for inference. Chapters 3 and 4 parallel the treatment of Chapters 4 and 5 of the first edition on the theory of testing and confidence regions, including some optimality theory for estimation as well and elementary robustness considerations. The main difference in our new treatment is the downplaying of unbiasedness both in estimation and testing and the presentation of the decision theory of Chapter 10 of the first edition at this stage. </p><p> Chapter 5 of the new edition is devoted to asymptotic approximations. It includes the initial theory presented in the first edition but goes much further with proofs of consistency and asymptotic normality and optimality of maximum likelihood procedures in inference. Also new is a section relating Bayesian and frequentist inference via the Bernsteinvon Mises theorem. </p><p> Finally, Chapter 6 is devoted to inference in multivariate (multiparameter) models. Included are asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimates, inference in the general linear model, Wilks theorem on the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test, the Wald and Rao statistics and associated confidence regions, and some parallels to the optimality theory and comparisons of Bayes and frequentist procedures given in the univariate case in Chapter 5. Generalized linear models are introduced as examples. Robustness from an asymptotic theory point of view appears also. This chapter uses multivariate calculus in an intrinsic way and can be viewed as an essential prerequisite for the more advanced topics of Volume II. </p><p> As in the first edition problems play a critical role by elucidating and often substantially expanding the text. Almost all the previous ones have been kept with an approximately equal number of new ones added&#x2014;to correspond to our new topics and point of view. The conventions established on footnotes and notation in the first edition remain, if somewhat augmented. </p><p> Chapters 1-4 develop the basic principles and examples of statistics. Nevertheless, we star sections that could be omitted by instructors with a classical bent and others that could be omitted by instructors with more computational emphasis. Although we believe the material of Chapters 5 and 6 has now become fundamental, there is clearly much that could be omitted at a first reading that we also star. There are clear dependencies between starred sections that follow: 5.4.2, 5.4.3, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 </p><p> Volume II is expected to be forthcoming in 2003. Topics to be covered include permutation and rank tests and their basis in completeness and equivariance. Examples of application such as the Cox model in survival analysis, other transformation models, and the classical nonparametric k sample and independence problems will be included.

His works, which number over 500, are of remarkable quality and have received the most positive criticism in the English press. &#34;Had he signed his pictures &#39;Jones,&#39; the critic would still find himself pausing in front of them,&#34; noted one Sunday Times of London art critic in 1949. Another opined that &#34;At least a dozen of these pictures will stand against any of the best impressionists.&#34; This exclusive, comprehensive collection of the paintings of one of the greatest statesmen in history is licensed by the Churchill Heritage, which will provide marketing support. Written by the renowned art critic who catalogued all of Churchill&#39;s paintings shortly after his death, along with Sir Winston&#39;s granddaughter-in-law, this sumptuous art book collects all of the images painted by Churchill, primarily in oil on canvas, and in essence provides a look at his life story through his paintings. It also includes authoritative text by the authors, Sir Winston&#39;s complete 1925 essay &#34;Painting as a Pastime,&#34; and 40 rare, previously unpublished photographs of Churchill and his world, in both color and black and white.</p><p><b>David Coombs</b> is the world-renowned art critic and writer who catalogued all of Churchill's paintings shortly after the statesman's death in 1965. He is a columnist for the UK's authorative weekly trade paper, <i>Antiques Gazette</i>. He lives in Surrey, United Kingdom. <b>Minnie Churchill</b> is Winston Churchill's granddaughter-in-law and is the current chairman of the Churchill Heritage.After Churchill was forced to resign from the WWI British government in 1915 at the age of 40, he took up oils and dived almost completely into painting. Sir Winston certainly didn&#x2019;t experiment much beyond shifting subject matters, but the "painting muse" that supposedly carried him out of his retirement depression seems to have been an overwhelming, transcendent influence on his later years. Published with the full cooperation of Churchill&#x2019;s family, this impressive 9" x 12" book offers a large-scale retrospective of the grand statesman&#x2019;s paintings. Its 500 full-color and black and white reproductions and photos are displayed smoothly throughout the glossy pages and described by precisely detailed captions. Coombs, former editor of The Antique Collector and a lifetime fellow at the Royal Society of Arts, provides historical background and political context for the sometimes-vivid oil paintings. Culled from Churchill&#x2019;s first days of painting at his Sulley farmhouse (and holidays in Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, Italy, the French Riviera and the United States), the paintings reflect a sincere interest in the meditative process of art-making, and are reminiscent of Monet, C�zanne and, when Churchill is at his best, perhaps Bonnard. Most are impressionistic landscapes or floral still lifes, along with the occasional portrait, such as one done in 1955 of Sir Winston&#x2019;s wife, Clementine Churchill, and others of various secretaries or political colleagues. The enthusiastic foreword is written by Churchill&#x2019;s only surviving child, Mary Soames. Two of Churchill&#x2019;s essays seek to explain the impetus behind the political giant&#x2019;s second life.

Marianne, emotional and sentimental, is the embodiment of sensibility. To each comes the sorrow of unhappy love. <br> &nbsp;<br> Their mutual suffering brings a closer understanding between the two sisters&#x2014;and true love finally triumphs when sense gives way to sensibility and sensibility gives way to sense. Jane Austen&#x2019;s authentic representation of early-nineteenth-century middle-class provincial life, written with forceful insight and gentle irony, makes her novels the enduring works on the mores and manners of her time.<br><br><b>With an Introduction by Margaret Drabble</b><br><b>and an Afterword by Mary Balogh&nbsp;</b></p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, follows the second edition of 1813, which corrects errors of the first edition.</p><h2>Children&#x2032;s Play</h2><p>Children's Play looks at the many facets of play and how it develops from infancy through late childhood.

Luckily, you are stronger than your habits. <br> <br>Let's look at some of the good habits you have in your life right now. (Good habits include things such as exercising regularly, being a loyal friend, or being on time.) <br> <br> <b>Think About Your Habits</b> <br> <br>Four of my really great habits are: <br> <br>1. <br> <br>2. <br> <br>3. <br> <br>4. <br> <br>The reason I keep these habits in my life is: <br> <br>The good results I get from having each good habit are: (For example: I have a habit of smiling at people I meet, and now people are friendlier to me.) <br> <br>Habits aren't always positive. In fact, they can be good, bad, or just neutral. Some habits I have that are neutral (they're neither good nor bad -- they're just habits) are: (For example: I put on one sock and then a shoe, then the other sock and the other shoe.) <br> <br>Now let's list some habits you're not so proud of. Complete the statements that follow: <br> <br>Right now, my worst habits are: <br> <br>The reason I have these bad habits is: <br> <br>I've had these bad habits for (days, weeks, years?): <br> <br>The bad results I get from having these bad habits are: (For example: I am late to school, which means I miss class discussion and get demerits toward my citizenship grade.) <br> <br>From my list of bad habits above, the one habit I would like to change the most is: <br> <br> <b>Change the Bad to Good</b> <br> <br>On the table below, fill in the habits that you named above. Keep this table handy during the upcoming week and use it as a tool to help you remember to change your bad habits to good ones. <br> <br> <b>Bad Habit I Want to Change/ Good Habit I Want to Replace it With </b> <br> <br> <b>In School:</b> <br> <br>1. <br> <br>2. <br> <br>3. <br> <br> <b>With My Family:</b> <br> <br>1. <br> <br>2. <br> <br>3. <br> <br> <b>With My Friends:</b> <br> <br>1. <br> <br>2. <br> <br>3. <br> <br> <b>Other:</b> <br> <br>1. <br> <br>2. <br> <br>3. <br> <br>A cool thing about the 7 Habits is how they build on each other. It's a progression -- just like learning arithmetic before calculus, learning the alphabet before learning to spell, or building a solid foundation before building a 150-story building. Trees grow this way, too; they put down solid roots before the trunk, branches, or leaves begin to grow. <br> <br> <b>Paradigms and Principles: What You See Is What You Get</b> <br> <br> <b>So What's a Paradigm?</b> <br> <br>A paradigm is the way you see something -- your point of view, frame of reference, or belief. As you may have noticed, sometimes your paradigms can be accurate, way off the mark, wrong, or incomplete. <br> <br>Did you know that from medieval times until the late 1800s doctors believed that a sick person had diseased blood? Doctors would "bleed" a person of the blood until they believed that they had drained the "diseased blood." This is, in fact, what killed George Washington, not the sore throat and fever he was suffering from. <br> <br>We now know about germs and that they can be in different parts of the body and in different forms. So now we treat illnesses with a different form of healing -- we no longer "bleed" a patient. That was an inaccurate and an incomplete way of looking at healing. <br> <br>Paradigms are like glasses. When you have incomplete paradigms about yourself or life in general, it's like wearing glasses with the wrong prescription. Those lenses affect how you see everything else. <br> -- Sean Covey <br> <br> <b>Top 10 All-Time Stupid Quotes:</b> <br> <br> <b>10.</b> "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home." <br> <br>Kenneth Olsen, President and Founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, in 1977 <br> <br> <b>9.</b> "Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value." <br> <br>Marshal Ferdinand Foch, French Military Strategist and <br>Future World War I Commander, in 1911 <br> <br> <b>8.</b> "[Man will never reach the moon] regardless of all future scientific advances." <br> <br>Dr. Lee De Forest, Inventor of the Audion Tube and Father of Radio, on February 25, 1967 <br> <br> <b>7.</b> "[Television] won't be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first six months.

Duell, U.S. Commissioner of Patents, in 1899 <br> <br>What are some other paradigms from history that have proved to be inaccurate or incomplete? (For example: The world is flat.) <br> <br>What kind of impact did these inaccurate paradigms from history have on the world? <br> <br> <b>� Paradigms of Self</b> <br> <br>A paradigm is the way you see something -- your point of view, frame of reference, or belief. So a paradigm of self is how you see yourself. No matter how you see yourself, you're probably right. If you think you are good at school, then you can be good at school. If you think you are no good at math, then you'll be no good at math. Paradigms of self can help or hinder you. Positive self-paradigms can bring out the best in you, while negative self-paradigms can limit you. <br> <br>Some positive paradigms I have about myself are: <br> <br>If someone were going to name something after me, it would be: <br> <br>Some negative paradigms I have about myself are: <br> <br>Paradigms that my parents or guardians, boss at work, or teachers at school might have about me are: <br> <br>Their paradigms match mine (true or false): <br> <br>Could they be right? How will I find out? <br> <br> <b>Self-Paradigm Assessment</b> <br> <br>Read the Paradigms of Self section on pages 13-16 of the <i>Teens</i> book. Now, evaluate how you see yourself by completing the assessment below. <br> <br> <b>Answer Yes or No</b> <br> <br> <i>I am someone who cares about others' feelings.<br><br>I am good at school.<br><br>I am a kind person.<br><br>I am generally a happy person.<br><br>I am intelligent.<br><br>I am helpful.<br><br>I am a good athlete.<br><br>I am talented.<br><br>I am a go-getter.<br><br>I am a good member of my family.<br><br>I am a bad person.<br><br>I am lazy.<br><br>I am rarely happy.<br><br>I am not smart.<br><br>I am not good at anything.<br><br>I am not attractive.<br><br>Yes/No<br><br>I am not popular.<br><br>I am not a good friend.<br><br>I am not honest.<br><br>I am not reliable.</i> <br> <br>If you identified at least one negative self-paradigm during the assessment, complete the statement below: <br> <br>One negative paradigm I would like to change is: <br> <br> <b>Paradigm Builder</b> <br> <br>If your self-paradigms are all wrong, what do you do? <br> <br>Spend time with someone who believes in me and recognizes my potential. For me, this person is: <br> <br>Drop friends who tear me down or believe I am like them. Friends I may need to drop are: <br> <br>Try to see things from other people's points of view to shift the paradigm. A situation I need to see the other side of is: <br> <br> <b>� Paradigms of Others</b> <br> <br>In the Paradigms and Principles chapter you learn that you have paradigms not only about yourself but also about other people. And they can be way out of whack. Seeing things from a different point of view can help you understand why other people act the way they do. Sometimes you judge people without having all the facts. <br> <br>Your paradigms are often incomplete, inaccurate, or completely messed up. Therefore, you shouldn't be quick to judge, label, or form rigid opinions of others, or of yourself, for that matter. From your limited point of view, you seldom see the whole picture, or have all the facts. You should open your mind and heart to new information, ideas, and points of view, and be willing to change your paradigms when it becomes clear that they're wrong. <br> <br>Friendship with one's self is all important, because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in <br>the world. <br> -- Eleanor Roosevelt <br> <br>Someone I may have judged inaccurately without having all the details is: <br> <br>I will change that paradigm by: (Describe the actions you can take immediately.) <br> <br>I can help others understand that their paradigms might be incomplete by: (Describe your actions or plan.) <br> <br> <b>� Paradigms of Life</b> <br> <br>Besides having paradigms about yourself and others, you have paradigms about the world in general. Whatever is important to you will become your paradigm, your glasses, or your life center. For teens, popular life centers include friends, stuff, boyfriends/girlfriends, school, parents, sports or hobbies, heroes, enemies, self, and work. Each of these life centers has its good points, but they are all incomplete in one way or another. The Paradigms and Principles chapter explains that you can always count on one center -- principles. <br> <br>If you don't take control of your life, don't complain when others do. <br> -- Beth Mende Conny <br> <br>To help determine your life center, answer the following survey. <br> <br>1.You are at home on a Tuesday night doing your trigonometry homework.

Life: Recipes and Adventures from My Home Kitchen</h2><p><b><b>FOREWORD INDIES&nbsp;Book of the Year Awards &#x2014;&nbsp;2017 BRONZE Winner for Cooking</b><br><br>In her first cookbook, the acclaimed chef,&nbsp;winner of a 2018 James Beard Award for Best Chef: New York City, shares her favorite cook-at-home recipes, inspired by her year off from professional cooking. </b><br><br> Missy Robbins had been on an upward trajectory through the ranks of chefdom, racking up accolades in Chicago at Spiaggia and in New York as the executive chef of A Voce Madison and A Voce Columbus, both of which earned Michelin stars under her leadership. But success in the grueling world of restaurant cooking took a toll, in sacrifices of time, health, and relationships. So in 2013 Robbins hung up the title of executive chef to explore life outside of the restaurant.<br><br> This book is a result of that year off: A collection of recipes that Robbins created in her tiny West Village kitchen while she rediscovered life outside of the restaurant world. These dishes, organized around essays narrating her year off, will help readers fall in love with cooking again, as Robbins did. In addition to pasta and the Italian-inspired dishes that Robbins is known for, there are her childhood favorites, such as chicken soup with ricotta dumplings, and breakfast, vegetable, and salad recipes, resulting from Robbins&#x2019;s commitment to healthier eating habits; there is also a chapter of Asian recipes, inspired by a long-wished-for trip to Vietnam and Thailand. Intimate, engaging, and filled with Robbins&#x2019;s signature thoughtful, ingredient-driven cooking, this cookbook gives readers the secrets to delicious and varied home cooking within a poignant story of self-discovery.</p><p><b>Missy Robbins</b>&nbsp;is recognized for her exemplary Italian cuisine.

He reveals the remarkable extent to which human feelings about bears have been and still are mixed. People have venerated, killed, caressed, tortured, nurtured, eaten, worshipped, and despised bears. Interestingly, the varied dealings of humans with bears raise the same question over and again: do our images of bears have much in common with the animal as it really is?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The book uncovers new and little-known stories and facts about bears in European, North American, Japanese, Russian, and South and Southeast Asian cultures. Taken together, these perspectives show us new things about the animals we thought we knew so well. Quirky and bizarre anecdotes, scientific information on bears threatened with extinction in some areas, a discussion of the phenomenon of bearanoia,&#x201d; and more than one hundred historical illustrations contribute to this unique account of the shared history between bears and humans and the continuing presence of bears in our personal and collective dreams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Bernd Brunner, a graduate of the Free University of Berlin and Berlin School of Economics, is an independent scholar, freelance writer, and editor of nonfiction books.

This book investigates what cannot be known. Rather than exploring the amazing facts that science, mathematics, and reason have revealed to us, this work studies what science, mathematics, and reason tell us cannot be revealed. In <i>The Outer Limits of Reason</i>, Noson Yanofsky considers what cannot be predicted, described, or known, and what will never be understood. He discusses the limitations of computers, physics, logic, and our own thought processes.</p><p>Yanofsky describes simple tasks that would take computers trillions of centuries to complete and other problems that computers can never solve; perfectly formed English sentences that make no sense; different levels of infinity; the bizarre world of the quantum; the relevance of relativity theory; the causes of chaos theory; math problems that cannot be solved by normal means; and statements that are true but cannot be proven. He explains the limitations of our intuitions about the world&#x2015;our ideas about space, time, and motion, and the complex relationship between the knower and the known.</p><p>Moving from the concrete to the abstract, from problems of everyday language to straightforward philosophical questions to the formalities of physics and mathematics, Yanofsky demonstrates a myriad of unsolvable problems and paradoxes. Exploring the various limitations of our knowledge, he shows that many of these limitations have a similar pattern and that by investigating these patterns, we can better understand the structure and limitations of reason itself. Yanofsky even attempts to look beyond the borders of reason to see what, if anything, is out there.</p></p><p>This is a popular science book that can be read by anyone interested in the limitations of science and mathematics. This book will also be of interest to people with a philosophical bent who are interested in how our universe works and what we can know about it.Noson S. Yanofsky is Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He is a coauthor of <i>Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists</i>.</p><h2>Heretics Anonymous</h2><p><p><strong>* Amazon Best Book of the Month August 2018 * New York Public Library Best Books 2018 *</strong> </p><p><strong>Put an atheist in a strict Catholic school?

Now, jazz authority Robert O&#x2019;Meally has collected the very best of Ellison&#x2019;s inspired, exuberant jazz writings in this unique anthology.</p><p>&#x201c;No Ellison fan or jazz aficionado should ignore this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;Most of us just listen to it, but Ellison truly inhabited jazz.

Prose rarely resonates like this.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;The nonfiction pieces repackaged here include considerations of blues, gospel, and flamenco. . . . As the slips of fiction and correspondence gathered here testify, all Ellison writing is jazz writing.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Entertainment </i>Weekly<br><br>&#x201c;[Ellison] may have stopped playing jazz, but he never stopped celebrating it throughout his long literary career.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;Whether he is writing a homage to Ellington on his seventieth birthday, analyzing how the blues infuses Richard Wright&#x2019;s autobiography or reviewing recordings of Mahalia Jackson, Ellison is insightful while keeping the focus on what role the music plays in American culture.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>Ralph Ellison was born in Oklahoma City in 1914. He was educated at the Frederick Douglass School and at Tuskegee Institute, where he studied the trumpet and music composition. Ellison moved to New York City in 1936 and lived in Harlem until his death in 1994. His novel <b>Invisible Man</b> (1952) was the winner of the National Book Award and one of the most important and influential American novels of the twentieth century. Ellison was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1975 and was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1985.<br><br>Robert G. O'Meally is the Zora Neale Hurston Professor of Comparative Literature at Columbia University and the founder and director of the Center for Jazz Studies. He is a leading interpreter of the dynamics of jazz in American culture. O'Meally is the author of several books, including <b>Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday </b>and <b>The Craft of Ralph Ellison</b>.

He lives in New York.</p><h2>Mansfield Park (Flipback)</h2><p>At the age of ten, shy, vulnerable Fanny Price leaves behind her impoverished family in Portsmouth to go and live with her rich relatives at Mansfield Park.</p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>God&#39;s Provision for Your Every Need</h2><p><p><b>God is with you in the desert.</b></p><p>Bishop T.D.

His two previous books, <i>Picture Perfect Practice</i> and <i>Picture Perfect Posing</i>, shattered the mold of instructional photography books as they empowered readers to advance their composition and posing skills. <i>Picture Perfect Lighting</i>, the third book in the <i>Picture Perfect</i> series, brings that same spirit and approach to teaching lighting. With it, Roberto empowers photographers to embrace lighting as a source of creativity and expression in service of their vision for the image. <br><br> In <i>Picture Perfect Lighting</i>, Roberto has created a truly original system for understanding and controlling light in photography. After discussing the universal nature of light, Roberto introduces the five key behaviors of light, which are essential to understand in order to improve your knowledge of light. With those behaviors established, Roberto introduces his concept of &#x201c;circumstantial light,&#x201d; an ingenious way of examining and breaking down the light around you in any given situation. Providing a detailed analysis of circumstantial light, Roberto develops the top ten circumstantial light elements you need to know in order to fully harness the power of the light around you to create an image that is true to your vision. <br><br> But how will you know if the circumstantial light is enough? The final piece of the <i>Picture Perfect Lighting</i> system is Roberto&#x2019;s &#x201c;lighting benchmark test,&#x201d; a brilliant method for determining the quality of the light in any given situation. It is with the lighting benchmark test that you will determine if and when you need to use &#x201c;helper light,&#x201d; the light that is needed or manipulated in order to &#x201c;help&#x201d; the circumstantial light so that your vision comes to life. Helper light is created with diffusers, reflectors, flashes, strobes, and light modifiers. <i>Picture Perfect Lighting</i> covers all of this in depth.<br><br> Don&#x2019;t limit yourself to using only one kind of light, and don&#x2019;t depend on Photoshop actions and plug-ins to create the &#x201c;wow&#x201d; factor in your images. That is the job of light. With <i>Picture Perfect Lighting</i> by your side, you will learn to master light. With that mastery, you will finally have the ability to create that true &#x201c;wow&#x201d; factor in camera&#x2015;and in your photographs.</p><p>Roberto Valenzuela is a photographer based in Beverly Hills, CA. He has been honored by Canon USA to be one of the few chosen photographers to be part of their prestigious Canon Explorers of Light program. Roberto believes that it is not talent but deliberate practice that is at the core of skill and achievement. He has traveled to every corner of the world motivating photographers to practice and break down the various elements of photography in order to master them through goal-setting, self-training, and constant dedication. He is the author of the bes-selling books <i>Picture Perfect Practice</i> and <i>Picture Perfect Posing</i>.</p><h2>Precalculus: Graphing and Data Analysis (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book motivates students by highlighting real people facing real challenges finding real solutions. This series features real workers at Motorola, along with hundreds of applications and real data sets highlighting the relevance and scope of activities a reader may encounter in life. <b> </b> Covers such topics as graphs, functions, polynomial and rational functions, the zeros of a polynomial function, exponential and logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, analytic trigonometry, applications of trigonometric functions, polar coordinates, vectors, analytic geometry, systems of equations and inequalities, sequence, induction, the binomial theorem, counting and probability, and more. <b> </b> For anyone interested in Precalculus. </p></p><p>PREFACE TO THE INSTRUCTOR <p> As professors at respectively an urban public university and a community college, Michael Sullivan and Michael Sullivan III are aware of the varied needs of Precalculus students, ranging from those having little mathematical background and fear of mathematics courses to those who have had a strong mathematical education and are highly motivated. For some of your students, this will be their last course in mathematics, while others might decide to further their mathematical education. This text is written for both groups. As the author of precalculus, engineering calculus, finite math, and business calculus texts, and as a teacher, Michael understands what students must know if they are to be focused and successful in upper level math courses. However, as a father of four, including the co-author, he also understands the realities of college life. Michael Sullivan III believes passionately in the value of technology as a tool for learning that enhances understanding without sacrificing important skills. Both authors have taken great pains to insure that the text contains solid, student-friendly examples and problems, as well as a clear and seamless writing style. We encourage you to share with us your experiences teaching from this text. In the Second Edition </p><p> The second edition builds upon a strong foundation by integrating new features and techniques that further enhance student interest and involvement. The elements of the previous edition that have proved successful remain, while many changes, some obvious, others subtle, have been made. The text has been streamlined to increase accessibility. A huge benefit of authoring a successful series is the broad-based feedback upon which improvements and additions are ultimately based. Virtually every change to this edition is the result of thoughtful comments and suggestions made by colleagues and students who have used the previous edition. This feedback has proved invaluable and has been used to make changes that improve the flow and usability of the text. For example, some topics have been moved to better reflect the way teachers approach the course. One significant change is the inclusion of the "Field Trip to Motorola" chapter projects. These projects take the incorporation of real life in mathematics to a higher level. The supplements package has been enhanced through upgrading traditional supplements and adding innovative media components such as MathPak, an Integrated Learning Environment. MathPak combines all of the text's key supplements into one easy-to-navigate software package.

PREFACE TO THE STUDENT </p><p> As you begin your study of Precalculus, you may feel overwhelmed by the number of theorems, definitions, procedures, and equations that confront you. You may even wonder whether or not you can learn all of this material in the time allotted. These concerns are normal. Keep in mind that many elements of Precalculus are all around us as we go through our daily routines. Many of the concepts you will learn to express mathematically, you already know intuitively. For many of you, this may be your last math course, while for others, it is just the first in a series of many. Either way, this text was written with you in mind. One of the coauthors, Michael Sullivan, has taught Precalculus courses for over thirty years. He is also the father of four college graduates, including this text's other co-author, who called home from time to time frustrated and with questions. We both know what you're going through. So we have written a text that doesn't overwhelm, or unnecessarily complicate Precalculus, but at the same time gives you the skills and practice you need to be successful. </p><p> This text is designed to help you the student, master the terminology and basic concepts of Precalculus. These aims have helped to shape every aspect of the book. Many learning aids are built into the format of the text to make your study of the material easier and more rewarding. This book is meant to be a "machine for learning," that can help you focus your efforts and get the most from the time and energy you invest. </p><p> Please do not hesitate to contact us through Prentice Hall with any suggestions or comments that would improve this text.</p><p>Best Wishes!<br> Michael Sullivan<br> Michael Sullivan, III</p></p><h2>Magical Herbal Baths of Santeria</h2><p>One of the reasons that Santeria has become so popular is due to the use of natural remedies and herbal medicines prepared by the Santero Priests. By combining elements of spirituality with that of nature, a Santero Priest can accomplish great success with even the most difficult case. Spiritual herbal baths are widely used in the Santeria religion. Although all of the ingredients are natural, when combined with powerful supernatural magic, these herbal baths can produce incredible results. Spiritual baths have been used for hundreds of years to heal sickness and for supernatural power. The Montenegro Family has been practicing Santeria for over 200 years. This book explores the mysteries and techniques of preparing herbal baths used in traditional Santeria. The book contains lists of herbs, oils, powders, rituals and other magical ingredients used by Santeros for hundreds of years. The book contains formulas for preparing Orisha baths, love baths, money baths, cleansing baths, sweet baths and also baths used in Palo Mayombe and traditional Mexican witchcraft.</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to Buddhist Philosophy (Cambridge Introductions to Philosophy)</h2><p>In this clearly written undergraduate textbook, Stephen Laumakis explains the origin and development of Buddhist ideas and concepts, focusing on the philosophical ideas and arguments presented and defended by selected thinkers and sutras from various traditions. He starts with a sketch of the Buddha and the Dharma, and highlights the origins of Buddhism in India. He then considers specific details of the Dharma with special attention to Buddhist metaphysics and epistemology, and examines the development of Buddhism in China, Japan, and Tibet, concluding with the ideas of the Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh. In each chapter he includes explanations of key terms and teachings, excerpts from primary source materials, and presentations of the arguments for each position.

Sven Lindqvist takes us on a daring intellectual trip to &#34;the heart of the darkness&#34; of the European mind and its attitude toward the &#34;Dark Continent.&#34; Like Edward Said&#39;s Orientalism, Lindqvist&#39;s book traces the legacy of European explorers, missionaries, politicians, and historians in Africa from the late eighteenth century onward. Lindqvist also examines the roots of European genocide, setting Conrad&#39;s Heart of Darkness in context and helping us to understand the most terrifying of Conrad&#39;s lines: &#34;Exterminate all the brutes.&#34;</p><p>In a chilling and controversial book, Swedish author Sven Lindqvist recounts the grisly history of 19th century European imperialism and its connection to a legacy of genocide. Moving crudely through present-day Africa while tracing the routes of British conquerors, Lindqvist tells how armed troops massacred 11,000 Sudanese with only 48 British deaths in 1898 and how the King of Ashanti was made to kiss the feet of British officers in 1896. Lindqvist doesn&#39;t stop in Africa, writing of the extermination of the Tasmanian aborigines and other atrocities inflicted on native people. He then connects those acts with those of the Nazi regime, showing how rampant imperialism sowed the seeds of the Holocaust. A moving account of the forces of history.Auschwitz, Mr. Lindqvist says, was "the modern industrial application of a policy of extermination on which European world domination had long since rested." -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Raleigh Trevelyan</i><br><br>Lindqvist's disturbing, brilliant work of historical sleuthing deserves to be taken up in a thousand classrooms. -- <i>Voice Literary Supplement</i><br><br>Sven Lindqvist is one of the most original and imaginative authors working at the end of the twentieth century. 'Exterminate All the Brutes' is serious stuff indeed, but it is written with brio and humor, and it unfolds like the telling of a detective story. -- <i>The Guardian [London]</i></p><h2>Be Holy (Leviticus): Becoming &#34;Set Apart&#34; for God (The BE Series Commentary)</h2><p><p>Discover what matters most to God.</p><p>We serve a holy God. And as His children, God longs for us to pursue a life that is pleasing to Him. But what does this look like? The book of Leviticus provides the answer. Originally written for the ancient Israelites, Leviticus continues to offer timeless principles for living that remain relevant to believers today. This study examines those principles, and explores how we can cultivate holiness in our daily lives.</p><p>Part of Dr. Warren W.

In this beautifully illustrated book, leading American and Peruvian scholars provide an unprecedented overview of the site, its place within the Inca empire, the mysteries surrounding its establishment and abandonment, and the discoveries made there since the excavations by archaeologist Hiram Bingham III in the early twentieth century.</p><p>Drawing upon the most recent scientific findings, the authors vividly describe the royal estate in the cloud forest where the Inca emperor and his guests went to escape the pressures of the capital. In addition to Bingham&#x2019;s exciting account of his first expedition in 1911, the book includes new and archival photographs of the site as well as color illustrations and explanations of some 120 gold, silver, ceramic, bone, and textile works recovered at Machu Picchu.</p></p><p>This book is the catalogue of an exhibition that opened at Yale University&#39;s Peabody Museum of Natural History. It will travel to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science from February 13 to May 9, 2004; the Houston Museum of Natural Science from June 4 to August 29, 2004; and the Field Museum of Chicago from October 8 to February 1, 2005, before returning to the Peabody Museum as a permanent exhibit.&#34;Despite its importance as a site of world heritage status, there has been virtually nothing substantive available on Machu Picchu. This appealing book, written by the preeminent scholars in the field, fills the gap beautifully.&#34;-Jeffrey Quilter, director of pre-Columbian studies, Dumbarton Oaks</p><h2>Calculus: The Classic Edition</h2><p>This edition of Swokowski&#39;s text is truly as its name implies: a classic. Groundbreaking in every way when first published, this book is a simple, straightforward, direct calculus text. It&#39;s popularity is directly due to its broad use of applications, the easy-to-understand writing style, and the wealth of examples and exercises which reinforce conceptualization of the subject matter. The author wrote this text with three objectives in mind. The first was to make the book more student-oriented by expanding discussions and providing more examples and figures to help clarify concepts. To further aid students, guidelines for solving problems were added in many sections of the text. The second objective was to stress the usefulness of calculus by means of modern applications of derivatives and integrals. The third objective, to make the text as accurate and error-free as possible, was accomplished by a careful examination of the exposition, combined with a thorough checking of each example and exercise.</p><p>Earl Swokowski authored multiple editions of numerous successful textbooks, including CALCULUS; CALCULUS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE; FUNDAMENTALS OF COLLEGE ALGEBRA; and PRECALCULUS: FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS, all published by Cengage Learning Brooks/Cole.1.

As well as covering indigenous species, it also includes all currently known invasive shrubs. Written by two leading experts in plant taxonomy, the guide is prepared in the same attractive, easy-to-use format as the bestselling Native Trees of the Midwest. Descriptive text explains how to identify every species in any season, and original color photographs taken by Sally Weeks detail all important characteristics. The authors provide practical guidance concerning the potential ornamental value of each species for those interested in landscaping and also evaluate their potential value for encouraging wildlife. Designed for experts in natural resource management as well as the interested general public, the volume includes distribution maps, identification keys, and an index of both common and Latin names.</p><p>Sally S. Weeks was born and grew up on a dairy farm near Winamac, Indiana. She received a BSF in wildlife management and a MS in forestry from Purdue&#39;s Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, where she now teaches tree and shrub identification. Harmon P. Weeks Jr. is a professor of wildlife science in forestry and natural resources at Purdue University and has taught habitat management for over thirty years. Michael Homoya is state botanist for the Indiana Division of Nature Preserves, holds two degrees in botany from Southern Illinois University, and is renowned for his knowledge of Midwestern flora.<p>The Herald Times [Bloomington, Indiana; May 5, 2012; by Bob Baird]</p><p>It was refreshing to run into a naturalist who knows her stuff and backs it up with a definitive volume with more than 1,000 color plates (her own) of leaves, stems, flowers, berries and landscape settings of shrubs and woody vines native to Indiana and surrounding states. Sally proved to be a personable, knowledgeable speaker who doesn&#x2019;t drift into horticultural babble. Her writing style is equally fresh and engaging. Besides identifying my mystery shrub, she and husband Mick, a retired Purdue wildlife biologist, brought wonderful insights to our neck of the woods.</p><br><br><p>Indiana Native Plant and Wildlife Society [Indianapolis, Indiana; Vol. 19, No. 2, Summer 2012; by Barbara Plampin, Ph.D., field botanist, and Life Director of the Shirley Heinze Land Trust]</p><p>This book makes identification as easy as it gets. The authors combine original keys and easy-to-use classifications in the table of contents with abundant gorgeous color photographs.</p><br><br>The dedicated authors have created a field guide for the Midwest, focusing on desirable native shrubs and vines for the landscape. &#x201c;Our personal landscaping goals have always revolved around attracting wildlife to the area and improving the landscape from an aesthetic as well as a diversity standpoint.&#x201d; They point out that these native plants are not only hardy, but also have many attractive characteristics. An illustrated glossary introduces readers to the particular plant parts that differentiate species. The plant directory is first divided into sections covering native versus introduced plants; these, in turn, are further divided by type. Summer and winter key guides assist the reader. Narrative passages for individual species include such characteristics as form and size, habitat, wildlife use, and landscaping value. Photographs of high clarity, locator maps, and tips on similar species are additional aids in identification.<br><br> &#x2014; Marilyn K. Alaimo, garden writer and volunteer, Chicago Botanic Garden.<br><br><br>This book is a wonderful marriage of information for both hmiiculturalists and those whose background is primarily in wildlife and forestry, the same background as Sally Weeks and Harmon Weeks, longtime educators at Purdue. Sally Weeks states in the preface that "our personal landscaping goals have always revolved around attracting wildlife to the area and improving the landscape from an aesthetic as well as a diversity standpoint." The book's content clearly reflects these ideas. The volume is divided into four main sections: "Native Shrubs," "Native Vines," "Introduced Shrubs," and "Introduced Vines." Every entry includes scientific/common names along with three to&nbsp;eight excellent photographs, a detailed range map, and a note regarding distinctions between similar species. Flowers and fruits are very good identifiers for plants, but are not typically present in the off-seasons (early spring, late fall, and winter). This book includes helpful photos of bark and terminal buds as well as form and size descriptions. An extensive index, a list of native-plant nurseries, and a dichotomous key support the text. Given the book's size, it may be considered a little heavy for field use, but the value of the content makes it wotih taking along. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Regional collections serving all general, academic, and professional audiences. --C.

Tucker came of age in the 1960s, and this spirited account of her life draws the reader directly into the burgeoning feminist movement and the excitement of the New York art world during that time. Her own new ways of thinking led her to take principled stands that have changed the way art museums consider contemporary art. As curator of painting and sculpture at the Whitney, she organized major exhibitions of the work of Lee Krasner, Joan Mitchell, Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, and Richard Tuttle, among others. As founder of the New Museum of Contemporary Art, she organized and curated groundbreaking exhibitions that often focused on the nexus of art and politics. The book highlights Tucker&#39;s commitment to forging a new system when the prevailing one proved too narrow for her expansive vision.</p><p>"Marcia was instrumental in introducing so many artists throughout her career, and I was one of them."&#x2015;Bruce Nauman<br><br>"I know of no other curator who has left a major museum and said, 'I'll start a new museum.' Marcia was for me a mentor, then a beacon, and later a role model. I consider myself fortunate."&#x2015;John Baldessari <br><br>"Marcia was a rebel with a cause: shaking up the staid world of art museums. She did it with vision, guts, and humor. We are forever indebted to her example."&#x2015;Guerrilla Girls<br><br>"<i>A Short Life Of Trouble</i>&#x2015;gossipy and delicious, smart and often deeply moving&#x2015;takes us through Marcia Tucker's tough but fascinating days as a young, adventurous curator at the Whitney Museum to her ambivalent triumphs and constant challenges as the visionary founder of the New Museum, and beyond. The author emerges as a fierce, outspoken champion of contemporary artists, especially the risk-takers who are often marginalized and overlooked or not an easy sell. Her intelligence, passion, immense generosity of spirit, and wry, witty observations on the battles and machinations of the New York art world of the 1980s and 1990s are alive on every page. Although in her quest to live a just, meaningful existence she was often hardest on herself, Marcia Tucker clearly knew how to have fun and made every minute count. This poignant memoir lets us glimpse the all-too-brief but rich and remarkable life of an extraordinary human being."&#x2015;Jessica Hagedorn, author of <i>Dream Jungle</i><b>Marcia Tucker, </b>who died in 2006, was a curator of contemporary art and the founder and director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City. <b>Liza Lou </b>is an artist.</p><h2>Plexus Anesthesia: Volume I Perivascular Techniques of Brachial Plexus Block (Plexus Anesthesia)</h2><p>Perivascular techniques of brachial plexus block.</p><p></p><h2>CliffsNotes on Orwell&#39;s 1984</h2><p>If your latest assignment has you so confused that you're actually beginning to think that 2 + 2 does equal 5, then let <b>CliffsNotes on 1984</b> help you navigate the tumultuous waters of George Orwell's dystopian world of Oceania.

When the first volume, <em>Early Jazz</em>, appeared two decades ago, it immediately established itself as one of the seminal works on American music. Nat Hentoff called it "a remarkable breakthrough in musical analysis of jazz," and Frank Conroy, in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, praised it as "definitive.... A remarkable book by any standard...unparalleled in the literature of jazz." It has been universally recognized as the basic musical analysis of jazz from its beginnings until 1933. <br> <em>The Swing Era</em> focuses on that extraordinary period in American musical history--1933 to 1945--when jazz was synonymous with America's popular music, its social dances and musical entertainment. The book's thorough scholarship, critical perceptions, and great love and respect for jazz puts this well-remembered era of American music into new and revealing perspective. It examines how the arrangements of Fletcher Henderson and Eddie Sauter--whom Schuller equates with Richard Strauss as "a master of harmonic modulation"--contributed to Benny Goodman's finest work...how Duke Ellington used the highly individualistic trombone trio of Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton, Juan Tizol, and Lawrence Brown to enrich his elegant compositions...how Billie Holiday developed her horn-like instrumental approach to singing...and how the seminal compositions and arrangements of the long-forgotten John Nesbitt helped shape Swing Era styles through their influence on Gene Gifford and the famous Casa Loma Orchestra. Schuller also provides serious reappraisals of such often neglected jazz figures as Cab Calloway, Henry "Red" Allen, Horace Henderson, Pee Wee Russell, and Joe Mooney.<br> Much of the book's focus is on the famous swing bands of the time, which were the essence of the Swing Era. There are the great black bands--Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Earl Hines, Andy Kirk, and the often superb but little known "territory bands"--and popular white bands like Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsie, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, plus the first serious critical assessment of that most famous of Swing Era bandleaders, Glenn Miller. There are incisive portraits of the great musical soloists--such as Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Bunny Berigan, and Jack Teagarden--and such singers as Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, and Helen Forest.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>: <br> <strong>Gunther Schuller</strong> began his professional career in 1943, at age seventeen, when he played French horn with the Cincinnati Symphony and later served as first horn in the Metropolitan Opera. A prominent American composer, he has written a wide range of orchestral and chamber music, as well as jazz compositions. He coined the phrase "Third Stream" to indicate music that fuses concert music and jazz. As an educator, he was associated with the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood for over twenty years, mostly as its Artistic Director, and he was President of the New England Conservatory of Music from 1967 to 1977. He has published three previous books, <em>Horn Technique</em> (1962), <em>Musings</em> (1986), and <em>Early Jazz: Its Roots and Musical Development</em> (1968). And he has been a guest conductor with major orchestras throughout North America and Europe.<br>Twenty years after the publication of Early Jazz , French hornist, conductor, composer, educator and broadcaster Schuller brings forth this 900-page second volume in his monumental "History of Jazz." He is perhaps better equipped to analyze style and technique than anyone else who has written about this music. No previous critic has delineated in as great detail how the various styles developed and coalesced. Schuller devotes 40 pages to Louis Armstrong, 110 pages and 62 musical examples to Duke Ellington. He identifies the unique characteristics of each of the big bandsamong them, Count Basie, Benny Carter, Lionel Hampton, Coleman Hawkins, Fletcher and Horace Henderson, Earl Hines, Jimmie Lunceford and Chick Webb; of arrangers Mel Powell, Don Redman and Eddie Sauter; of such soloists as Bunny Berigan, Charlie Christian, Roy Eldridge, Billie Holiday, Art Tatum, Jack Teagarden, Ben Webster and Teddy Wilson; of the small groups of Nate Cole, John Kirby, Red Nichols and Rex Stewart; even of the "territory bands" of the Middle West. He also explicates the contributions of the big white bands of Charlie Barnet, Bob Crosby, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Harry James, Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller and Claude Thornhill, who, by codifying and expanding upon the innovations of their black counterparts, played as crucial a role and brought jazz to millions who otherwise would never have heard any jazz at all. Schuller's evaluations are original, trenchant and even-handed: He discusses shortcomingsstylistic stultification, topheavy sound, exuberant vulgarity, for exampleas well as achievements. And he demonstrates the gradual atrophying of swing by repetition, formularization, the reduction of improvisation and loss of spontaneity. More brilliantly than anyone before him, Schuller has explained a glorious period in the history of American music.

While this catalogue of a traveling exhibition recognizes the painter's vocal jingoism and racism, it aims to show that he was much more than a facile celebrant of American frontier life. In Remington's later paintings, a literal realism gave way to impressionism and symbolism. His pure, almost abstract landscapes and romantic nocturnes suggest that white settlers could live in harmony with nature instead of imposing their will on it. The energy and dynamism of his darkly encrusted, cantilevered sculptures are undeniable. Remington's awareness that the destruction of Amerindian civilization was a national tragedy is reflected in his little-known, melodramatic novels and short stories, as one of the essays here makes clear. With 180 plates (half in color), this album highlights his diverse artistic outlets, from photography to drawing. Shapiro is chief curator at the St. Louis Art Museum; Hassrick is director of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center. BOMC dividend selection, American Artist Book Club alternate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.A catalog designed to accompany a traveling exhibition of some of Remington's best-known paintings, this work includes essays by Peter Hassrick, author of an earlier monograph on Remington, and several other scholars. The aim of this latest addition to Remingtoniana is twofold: to place the artist and his work in the context of late 19th-century American and Western culture; and to win for Remington his due as an artist and not merely as an illustrator of cowboys and Indians. The latter aim is achieved by building for him a conventional art historical nicheand the tone of this argument is strained. Recommended for larger libraries. Raymond L.

The author, who believes integration within the discipline is critical, makes the case that its empirical and theoretical aspects can be unified under the umbrella of adaptation. The principles of learning, and the characteristics of memory and language&#x2014;our adaptation to a challenging environment&#x2014;are pertinent to all we do, and the sciences of learning and cognition are the subject areas most relevant to these proximate behavior-environment relationships. Because the adaptability of a behavior is often tied to its function, the author's functional perspective serves as a helpful organizational tool for studying the otherwise disparate aspects of learning and cognition&#x2014;thinking, memory, conceptual behavior, and language.<p> New to this edition is an emphasis on applied behavior analysis, a rapidly growing and credentialed profession. Updated pedagogical features include opening chapter vignettes, interim summaries and review questions, improved graphics, and a full glossary of key terms.</p><p> Not-for-sale instructor's resource materials available online to college and university faculty only; contact publisher directly.</p><p> Title of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Lutz, <i>Learning and Memory,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577663614).</p></p><p></p><h2>God&#39;s Laboratory: Assisted Reproduction in the Andes</h2><p>Assisted reproduction, with its test tubes, injections, and gamete donors, raises concerns about the nature of life and kinship. Yet these concerns do not take the same shape around the world. In this innovative ethnography of in vitro fertilization in Ecuador, Elizabeth F.S. Roberts explores how reproduction by way of biotechnological assistance is not only accepted but embraced despite widespread poverty and condemnation from the Catholic Church. Roberts&#x2019; intimate portrait of IVF practitioners and their patients reveals how technological intervention is folded into an Andean understanding of reproduction as always assisted, whether through kin or God. She argues that the Ecuadorian incarnation of reproductive technology is less about a national desire for modernity than it is a product of colonial racial history, Catholic practice, and kinship configurations. God&#x2019;s Laboratory offers a grounded introduction to critical debates in medical anthropology and science studies, as well as a nuanced ethnography of the interplay between science, religion, race and history in the formation of Andean families.</p><p>&#x201c;Bold and gripping, <i>God&#x2019;s Laboratory</i> is ethnography at its best. The book&#x2019;s unforgettable characters and their desperate travails to reproduce via global medicine are the very fabric of a highly-original and much-needed social theory for our twenty-first century technological societies.&#x201d; - Jo�o Biehl, author of <i>Vita: Life in a Zone of Social Abandonment</i><br><br>"<i>God&#x2019;s Laboratory</i> is the perfect anthropological antidote to the fetishization of reproductive materials as 'life itself.' Roberts shows in meticulous detail and in luminous prose how Catholic scientists and technicians in Ecuador invite God into private IVF labs to &#x2018;bless the work&#x2019; of producing embryos. Kinship, care, and cultivation -- not embryonic life -- define reproduction in this uncertain world." - Nancy Scheper-Hughes, author of <i>Death Without Weeping: The Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil</i><br><br>&#x201c;Written with clarity, compassion, and self-reflection, <i>God's Laboratory</i> is a beautiful book which puts the ethnographic method to excellent use. Roberts's painstaking fieldwork unearthed the many layers through which the aspirations for fertility and use of infertility technologies instantiate not only gender and kinship in Ecuador, but ethnicity, race and region in the national project of modernity. The book is a stunning instance of the benefits which accrue when the study of reproduction is used as an optic for understanding social life.&#x201d; - Rayna Rapp, author of <i>Testing Women, Testing the Fetus: The Social Impact of Amniocentesis in America</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>God&#x2019;s Laboratory</i> is a strong, intriguing and careful look at the daily connections between faith and science that underpin the process of human assisted reproduction in urban Ecuador." -Marisol de la Cadena, author of <i>Indigenous Mestizos: The Politics of Race and Culture in Cuzco, Peru, 1910-1991</i><br><br><b>Elizabeth Roberts</b> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at University of Michigan.</p><h2>Patton&#39;s Pawns: The 94th US Infantry Division at the Siegfried Line</h2><p><br>The 94th US Infantry Division was an organization formed late in the Second World War, made up largely of draft-deferred university students as enlisted men and an officer corps pulled together from various domestic postings with unfortunate consequences for mutual trust and respect.<br><p>Initially used as part of the force blockading the Brittany ports after D-Day, in December of 1944, the division was incorporated into General Patton&#x2019;s Third Army south of the Moselle-Saar Triangle, the base of which was a portion of the Siegfried Line known as the Orscholz Switch. Its first combat experience came in battalion-sized attacks during that terrible winter while the Battle of the Bulge raged to the north, and the Division suffered heavy casualties, many due to the ferocity of the winter weather. Patton, with characteristic zeal, excoriated the division&#x2019;s officers and senior NCOs for the rate of non-combat casualties. Thereafter, the division was ordered forward on an all-out assault to break through the Siegfried Line. After horrific fighting against entrenched defenders, with ice turning to mud as spring approached, on February 19, 1945, the 94th broke through to open the roads to Trier and the Rhine.<br><br> This book is the most comprehensive study to date of the fierce fighting between the 94th U.S. Infantry Division and their German counterparts during that spring of 1945. It sheds new light on the achievements of the outnumbered division in penetrating Germany&#x2019;s Westwall. With characteristic verve and detail, Tony Le Tissier narrates the action and illuminates the tribulations and sacrifices of American soldiers who won their laurels at great cost.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br></p><p><br><p><b>Tony Le Tissier</b> is a retired French &#x2014;and German &#x2014;speaking lieutenant colonel in the British military.

Second, it makes the salient point that the 1945 campaign to conquer Nazi Germany was no walkover. Instead, it was a bloody, costly, demoralizing struggle. By and large, the Germans did not capitulate. They fought very hard, and Le Tissier illustrates this quite well.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Journal of Military History</i><br>"This new and exceedingly detailed divisional history . . . is a well-written narrative with excellent, appropriate maps, drawings, and photographs."&#x2014; Russel A.

The strengths of the text clearly lie in the attention to congressional procedure. The text offers a detailed explanation of difficult concepts like filling the amendment tree and the budget and appropriation process. These sometimes highly technical concepts are explained in comprehensive yet clear terms and usually are accompanied by a visual aid of some sort. The graphics are especially important for the students. The explanation also includes plentiful examples and anecdotes from the process. These anecdotes are particularly illuminating when it comes to understanding how the rules and norms of the House and Senate are put into action by members." -- Jason D.

Structured around major movements in world history, the lives of leading educators, and the philosophies and ideologies that resulted from their ideas, this unique text provides a clear interdisciplinary exploration of the development of educational ideas. The author takes a global perspective on the history and philosophy of education, capturing the essence of educational evolution through the biographies of 23 theorists, philosophers, and educators. This biographical focus, combined with an introductory presentation of the inherent connections between education&#39;s major movements and its primary movers helps students better understand the social and historical conditions that have informed today&#39;s educational arena.</p><p>Structured around the biographies of acclaimed educators, philosophers and world figures, this text combines both a historical overview of world education and a balanced treatment of leading educational philosophies. It emphasizes both the importance of contexts and situations in the development of educational ideas as well as those features of educational theories that transcend particular historical contexts. The Second Edition has been expanded--now profiling several more educational figures--and updated to reflect recent international developments.PREFACE <p> Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: A Biographical Introduction developed from my more than three decades of teaching the history and philosophy of education at Loyola University Chicago and as a visiting professor at Northern Michigan University, Otterbein College, and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Over time, the identification of the biographies and development of the chapters were stimulated by discussions with my students. The book reflects my belief that educational biography is a valuable, powerful, but too-often neglected medium for preparing teachers, administrators, and other professionals in education. I hope the book's third edition will continue to focus more attention on the use of educational biography in professional education programs. Organization and Coverage </p><p> As the book's title indicates, I have organized its contents around three broad themes: major movements in world history, the biographies of leading educators, and the philosophies and ideologies that came from their ideas. As a historian, I have been intrigued by the interaction of individuals in their historical contexts and how they create meaning from their transaction with the cultural situation of living at a given time and place. </p><p> As a teacher of the history of Western and American education, I decided to structure the book around the major movements in Western world history: the classical periods of ancient Greece and Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the Enlightenment, the age of revolution, the foundations of the United States, the Industrial Revolution, the rise of ideologies, the progressive movement, the end of imperialism in the postcolonial world, the rise of African American consciousness, and Marxism (as reflected in the Cultural Revolution of the People's Republic of China). This kind of periodization around broad historical currents helped me to construct a cognitive map on which I could locate people and events and give myself a perspective on the past. However, I also determined that this kind of periodization should not simply be chronological but should be enlivened by lives that represented the efforts, the trials and errors, and achievements of those who shaped the history and philosophy of education. </p><p> My interest in biography�the stories of lives&#x2014;provided a means to give the great movements of human history a personal face. Biography enables us to see ourselves through the lives of others. For each of the great movements in history, I identified an important contributor to educational philosophy and method. For ancient Greece and Rome, there were Plato, the founder of idealism; Aristotle, the founder of realism; and Quintilian, an exemplary teacher of rhetoric. Medieval Christianity was epitomized by the great theologian Thomas Aquinas. Erasmus was the ideal representative of Renaissance humanism. John Calvin and Johann Amos Comenius represented two different ways of interpreting the educational changes produced by the Protestant Reformation. For the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment eras, the figures of lean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi stood out in bold relief. For the age of revolution and republicanism three persons7#151;Thomas Jefferson, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Horace Mann&#x2014;were leading characters. Jefferson made the intellectual connection between the Enlightenment's rationalism and the republican impulse in North America. Mary Wollstonecraft undertook a revolution for women's rights. Horace Mann was a strong voice for creating public education for the new American republic. Educational responses to the Industrial and Darwinian revolutions came from such theorists as Robert Owen, a utopian socialist; John Stuart Mill, a liberal; and Herbert Spencer, a social Darwinist. Early twentieth-century progressivism is exemplified by Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, and John Dewey, America's leading Pragmatist philosopher. The rights of children were asserted by Friedrich Froebel, founder of the kindergarten, and Maria Montessori, who created her own version of early childhood education. The attack on colonialism came from Mohandas Gandhi, who won India's independence by nonviolent resistance. W E. B. Du Bois's commitment to equality of persons signaled a rising African American consciousness that would lead to pan-Africanism. The ideas of Karl Marx sparked the ready revolutionary activism of China's Mao Tse-tung. </p><p> At various times in my academic career, I have taught courses in philosophy of education. As I examined the lives of the great educators in their historical contexts, their views on philosophy of education&#x2014;what constitutes the educated person&#x2014;surfaced and came into perspective. I found that my students, too, gained deeper insights into philosophy of education by making connections with founding figures. For example, an examination of Plato's ideas leads to a consideration of philosophical idealism, Aristotle's ideas to realism, Thomas Aquinas to Thomism, Erasmus to humanism, Comenius to Pansophism, Rousseau to naturalism, and Dewey to Pragmatism. </p><p> I found that the lives and ideas of certain key figures provided students with an understanding of ideology and how ideology influences educational policy. Here, Robert Owen provides insights into utopianism, Mary Wollstonecraft into feminism, John Stuart Mill into liberalism, Herbert Spencer into social Darwinism, Jane Addams into progressivism, W E. B. Du Bois into pan-Africanism, and Mao into Marxism. </p><p> Although the various major historical, philosophical, and ideological currents are rich and complex, how the world's leading educators interacted with the context of their lives to create their own meanings of education cuts across this complexity. Because an individual's life is multifaceted, biography becomes a tool that provides a clear, interdisciplinary way to look at the development of educational ideas. Each educator treated leads us to a broader and more generous appreciation of our educational heritage, and often illuminates current challenges. Format </p><p> The book provides students with an interesting and personal but structured way to examine the historical and philosophical foundations of education. The first chapter examines how educational biography can be used in teacher and professional education programs. The following sections are included in each of the subsequent chapters:</p><p>The Historical Context that places the educational thinker in the historical, cultural, and philosophical situation of her or his time. A Biography of the educational thinker that analyzes the formative persons and events that shaped his or her educational philosophy or ideology. An Analysis of the Educational Thinker's Philosophy or Ideology that identifies the theorist's principal ideas about truth and value, education and schooling, and teaching and learning. A Conclusion that assesses the educational contributions and significance of the theorist. Discussion Questions, intended for in-class use, that relate the educational thinker to both her or his time in history and to the present situation in education. Research and Essay Topics that lead to analysis of trends and issues in the history, philosophy, and ideology of education. Suggestions for Further Reading that include both long-standing and recent books. Features </p><p> Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: A Biographical Introduction, Third Edition, offers the following features:</p><p>An examination of the historical, philosophical, and ideological foundations of education through the study of the biographies of the world's leading educational thinkers. An examination of the history and philosophy of education in a single book that is especially useful in courses that integrate these fields. A solid grounding in the historical and philosophical foundations of education based on sustained teaching experience. Discussion questions and research topics that set students on the path to becoming their own historians and philosophers of education. New to This Edition </p><p> It is not easy to choose the major figures to treat in a book such as this. Every professor of history and philosophy of education has his or her own favorites. After consultation with professors who used the second edition, I determined to again feature the 22 theorists, philosophers, and educators who were treated in that edition. The second edition had been expanded by adding chapters examining the biographies and educational ideas of Aristotle, Johann Amos Comenius, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, and Mao Tse-tung. The third edition has been updated and the suggested readings revised to include recent publications in the field. In particular, the biographies of Thomas Aquinas, Erasmus, Horace Mann, Friedrich Froebel, Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Addams, and John Dewey have been expanded. The chapter on Horace Mann more clearly indicates how he was a major leader in creating the state and local governance partnership in American public education. I have revised the chapter on Jane Addams to reflect her pioneering multiculturalism. Dewey is more directly connected to the current revival of Pragmatism and liberalism. Du Bois is shown to have had a larger impact on general historical and sociological scholarship as well as on African American education. The chapter on Mao Tse-tung includes an expanded discussion of the Confucian heritage that Mao sought to eliminate in the People's Republic of China. Acknowledgements </p><p> My biographical and historical interests were developed by my graduate education at the University of Illinois in Urbana. Professors J. Leonard Bates, Arthur E. Bestor, Jr., and Norman Graebner were masters in developing for their students the importance of people in historical contexts. My study with Professor Harry Broudy emphasized that educators benefited from having a perspective on the development of educational ideas over time. The experimentalist theme of people interacting within their contexts owes much to the introduction to John Dewey that I received from William O. Stanley and Joe Burnett. Archibald Anderson, my major professor, provided the insights that placed the history of education in its broad cultural context. It was Professor Anderson who encouraged me to write my first biography of an educator, my doctoral dissertation on George S. Counts. </p><p> I appreciate the advice, support, and patience of Debbie Stollenwerk, my editor at Prentice Hall, who encouraged me to prepare a third edition. I want to thank Mary Harlan, my production editor, and freelance copyeditor Robert L. Marcum for working with me to bring this third edition to publication. </p><p> I also want to acknowledge the insights provided by my colleagues in the history and philosophy of education who reviewed the book and made excellent suggestions that guided my revisions: Carlton E.

The Archive is not a library or a research collection in the conventional sense but rather a disorganized and fugitive space for the development of a political consciousness of being indifferent to the deadly forms of power that characterize our society. Housed by the Archive are autonomous radicals, runaways, abolitionists, commoners, and dreamers who no longer live as obedient or merely resistant subjects.</p><p>In this innovative, genre- and format-bending publication, Avery F. Gordon, the &#x201c;keeper&#x201d; of the Archive, presents a selection of its documents&#x2015;original and compelling essays, letters, cultural analyses, images, photographs, conversations, friendship exchanges, and collaborations with various artists. Gordon creatively uses the imaginary of the Archive to explore the utopian elements found in a variety of resistive and defiant activity in the past and in the present, zeroing in on Marxist critical theory and the black radical tradition. Fusing critical theory with creative writing in a historical context, The Hawthorn Archive represents voices from the utopian margins, where fact, fiction, theory, and image converge.</p><p>Reminiscent of the later fictions of Italo Calvino or Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s Arcades Project, <i>The Hawthorn Archive</i> is a groundbreaking work that defies strict disciplinary, methodological, and aesthetic boundaries. And like <i>Ghostly Matters: Haunting and the Sociological Imagination</i>, which established Gordon as one of the most influential interdisciplinary scholars of the humanities and social sciences in recent years, it provides a kaleidoscopic analysis of power and effect. <i>The Hawthorn Archive</i>&#x2019;s experimental format and inventive synthesis of critical theory and creative writing make way for a powerful reconception of what counts as social change and political action, offering creative inspiration and critical tools to artists, activists, scholars across various disciplines, and general readers alike.</p></p><p>Avery F. Gordon is Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Visiting Professor in the Birkbeck Department of Law, University of London. Her most recent books are <i>The Workhouse </i>(with Ines Schaber), <i>Ghostly Matters, and Keeping Good Time</i>.<br>"<em>The Hawthorn Archive</em> opens a path for thinking in its extended engagement with the documents and ephemera of utopian thought. Avery Gordon creates an innovative and dazzling account of global efforts to live in the here and now that refuse the brutal dispositions of racial capitalism and create the 'what might be.' It is an exercise in runaway thought; it is a blues, a manifesto, a love letter, and a freedom dream."--Saidiya Hartman, <em>Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route</em><p></p><br>"The Hawthorne Archive is the 'Where's Waldo?' of theoretical treasure hunts. Avery Gordon's not-so-imaginary archive is a multi-media jig-saw puzzle, a plurivocal mystery story, an epistemic chameleon of present tenses, shimmering hints, fragmentary indices, and stumbling stones that keep moving. This is a curatorial masterpiece whose 'utopian margins' are as imperfectly futuristic, fleeting, and incommensurable as history itself."----Patricia J. Williams "James L. Dohr Professor of Law, Columbia University School of Law "<br><br>"The Hawthorne Archive offers an expansive theory of utopia in the form of a literary experiment. In this beautiful assemblage of the thoughts and deeds of vagabonds, anarchists, fugitives, deserters, idlers, radicals, storytellers, and artists, Avery Gordon, the keeper of the archive, creates an innovative and dazzling account of global efforts to live and create the "what might be." The Hawthorne Archive opens a path for thinking through an extended engagement with the documents and ephemera of utopian thought, which is defined broadly as a standpoint for living in the here and now that refuses the brutal dispositions of racial capitalism. It is a serial work whose iterations of radical and anarchist thought unfold in a speculative engagement and imaginative encounter with historical documents, social movements, novels, visual art, film and photography, and the ephemera of refusal. This archive of letters, essays, dialogues, images and documents becomes a collective utterance of the struggle to create another world inside this one. The Hawthorne Archive is an exercise in run-away thought; it is a blues, a manifesto, a love letter, and a freedom dream."----Saidiya Hartman "Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route "</p><h2>Adams and Victor&#39;s Principles of Neurology (8th Edition)</h2><p><b>A new take on the classic, definitive text on the full spectrum of neurology.</b> Reflecting a modern approach to neurology, <i>Adams and Victors Principles of Neurology, 8/e</i> new format highlights a more complete and accessible approaches to treatment and clinical management strategies.

In middle age he retreats into a private world, hunting for Roman artifacts and devoting himself to bizarre mystical beliefs. Robert's wife, Bertha, feels that there are few things more dreadful than a husband who will persist in making a fool of himself in public. Their marriage consists of horrible quarrels, futile arguments, incessant bickering. Scarcely any friends will visit the Kewdinghams in their peaceful hometown Shufflecester.</p><p>Everything is wrong&#x2015;and with the entrance of John Harrigall, a bohemian bachelor from London who catches Bertha's eye, they take a turn for the worse.

In this case, there are two would-be murderers, one motivated by the hatred engendered by how her husband treats her, the other apparently motivated by sheer sociopathy. The hoped-for victim, Robert Arthur Kewdingham, is unappealing on every level. He ignores his family (wife and child) as they sink into genteel poverty, and he indulges himself in hypochondria, mysticism, bad temper, and what would now be described as hoarding (but he labels it collecting). His young wife starts adding lead acetate to his food. His doctor (whose elderly aunt and invalid wife both died suddenly) brews up an experimental blend of aluminum chlorate for his patient. Part of the chilling fun of this book is found in the author's stark assessments of his murderous characters. We don't come to sympathize with them by knowing their interior worlds; we watch their movements in shock from the outside. The other part of the fun is observing how the wife's and doctor's plans unwittingly counteract each other.

One might wonder whether the discipline of philosophy even recognizes love. The word <i>philosophy</i> means &#x201c;love of wisdom,&#x201d; but the absence of love from philosophical discourse is curiously glaring. So where did the love go? In <i>The Erotic Phenomenon,</i> Jean-Luc Marion asks this fundamental question of philosophy, while reviving inquiry into the concept of love itself.</p> <p>Marion begins his profound and personal book with a critique of Descartes&#x2019; equation of the ego&#x2019;s ability to doubt with the certainty that one exists&#x2014;&#x201c;I think, therefore I am&#x201d;&#x2014;arguing that this is worse than vain. We encounter being, he says, when we first experience love: I am loved, therefore I am; and this love is the reason I care whether I exist or not. This philosophical base allows Marion to probe several manifestations of love and its variations, including carnal excitement, self-hate, lying and perversion, fidelity, the generation of children, and the love of God. Throughout, Marion stresses that all erotic phenomena, including sentimentality, pornography, and even boasts about one&#x2019;s sexual conquests, stem not from the ego as popularly understood but instead from love.</p> <p>A thoroughly enlightening and captivating philosophical investigation of a strangely neglected subject, <i>The Erotic Phenomenon</i> is certain to initiate feverish new dialogue about the philosophical meanings of that most desirable and mysterious of all concepts&#x2014;love.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Jean-Luc Marion </b>is professor of philosophy at the University of Paris-Sorbonne Paris IV, and the John Nuveen Distinguished Professor in the Divinity School and professor in the Committee on Social Thought and the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago.

During the last thirty-five years of his life, he taught thousands of Westerners and founded Zen centers throughout the United States, Europe, and Mexico. <i>Appreciate Your Life </i> conveys the unique spirit and teaching style of this important figure, as well as his timeless insights into the practice of Zen. <i>Appreciate Your Life </i> also includes a lengthy foreword by Bernie Glassman, Maezumi Roshi's successor and a prominent contemporary Zen teacher and author. Maezumi Roshi was known to tell his students not to go searching for "Zen," but instead to develop an appreciation for their own lives as their greatest teacher. The readings in <i>Appreciate Your Life </i> are not teachings or instruction in the traditional sense. They are transcriptions of the master's <i>teisho</i>, his presentations of his direct experience of Zen realization. These <i>teisho</i> are crystalline offerings of Zen insight intended to reach beyond the student's intellect to her deepest essence.</p><p>Do a roll call of the major foreign Zen priests who lived in America to transmit Zen, and you have a pretty short list: Shunryu Suzuki, Seung Sahn, and Taizan Maezumi. Of these, Maezumi is the least well-known, though he transmitted to 12 successors and established 35 Zen centers. In the great Zen tradition of recording a master's words, Maezumi's students have brought together a number of his <i>teisho</i>, presentations to the disciples of a master's realization. Rather than general lectures or public talks, these short pieces were meant to be heard at times of intense practice, during breaks in meditation, when the student's mind is piqued for sparks of enlightenment. Maezumi touches on subjects relevant to the serious practitioner--the bodhi mind, life as a koan, practicing the paramitas, copying sutras, etc. Though not technically difficult, these pieces assume a background in the fundamentals of Buddhism, perfect for the increasing number of readers who have progressed beyond the introductory level and seek more sophisticated guidance. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Taizan Maezumi Roshi (1931&#x2013;1995) was a seminal figure in the transmission of Zen Buddhism to the West. He was founding abbot of the Zen Center of Los Angeles (ZCLA) from 1967 to 1995 and of Zen Mountain Center from 1978 to 1995. He and his successors also founded Zen centers throughout the United States, Europe, and Mexico. Maezumi Roshi established The Kuroda Institute for the Study of Buddhism and Human Values, which promotes Buddhist scholarship and publishes, with the University of Hawaii Press, translations of East Asian Buddhist classics. He coauthored <i>On Zen Practice: Foundation of Practice, On Zen Practice II: Body, Breath and Mind, </i> and <i>The Hazy Moon of Enlightenment. </i> He also provided the commentary for <i>The Way of Everyday Life: Zen Master Dogen's Genjokoan. </i></p><h2>College Reading 2</h2><p>The Reading strand focuses on the development of the reading skills students need to be successful in college.

Richard Holloway retells the entire history of religion&#x2014;from the dawn of religious belief to the twenty-first century&#x2014;with deepest respect and a keen commitment to accuracy. Writing for those with faith and those without, and especially for young readers, he encourages curiosity and tolerance, accentuates nuance and mystery, and calmly restores a sense of the value of faith.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ranging far beyond the major world religions of Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, Holloway also examines where religious belief comes from, the search for meaning throughout history, today&#x2019;s fascinations with Scientology and creationism, religiously motivated violence, hostilities between religious people and secularists, and more. Holloway proves an empathic yet discerning guide to the enduring significance of faith and its power from ancient times to our own.</p><p>For curious readers of all ages and beliefs, this rich and colorful history explores religion from humanity&#x2019;s earliest days to our own contentious times. Richard Holloway illuminates the beliefs of major and minor religions, the sources of religiously motivated violence, the place of faith in a secular world, and much more.<b>What made you want to write this book? </b> <br> &nbsp; <br> I have been wrestling with the meaning of religion for most of my life. Writing the book was an opportunity to survey the whole field, not just the little corner I was familiar with. <br> &nbsp; <br> <b>How do you think your own background informed the book?</b> <br> &nbsp; <br> For most of my life I was what you might call a religious professional, but it was never an easy relationship. It was like being in a turbulent marriage: deep affection combined with endless argument and disagreement. <br> &nbsp; <br> The difficulty is that religion, which is best understood as the human search for meaning, changes character when it becomes organized into a system that makes claims for itself, usually claims to superiority over other systems. Much the way political parties do. So religion ceases to be an exploration and becomes something more defensive. It&#x2019;s like the difference between a wanderer and a settler. In religion, it&#x2019;s important to recognize that some things will never be settled and to live with that uncertainty. <br> &nbsp; <br> <b>What role should religion play in our lives?</b> <br> &nbsp; <br> Whatever role we choose for ourselves&#x2014;including none at all&#x2014;as long as there is no compulsion about it and as long as it makes us kinder not more cruel. The fascinating thing about religion is that it can prompt us to extremes of either love or hatred.

Some, like the giant squid, existed only as rumors until hard evidence finally appeared. And then there are the others, who roam a shadowy realm between myth, hucksterism and science--for example, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. Cryptozoology is the quest for unidentified and elusive species, and as such is often treated as a marginalized science more akin to farcical adventure. However, the subject makes for a perfectly fascinating zone of inquiry for contemporary artists interested in the fertile edges of the history of science and museums, taxonomy, myth, spectacle and fraud. <i>Cryptozoology: Out of Time Place Scale</i> mines the theoretical and design terrains of the twenty-first-century graphic novel and the medieval curio cabinet or <i>Wunderkammer</i>, exploring cryptozoology in art and popular culture. Originally exhibited at Maine's Bates College Museum of Art, it begins with Mark Dion's installation of a bureaucratic government agency, the Federal Wildlife Commission's Department of Cryptozoology, Bureau for the Investigation of Paranormal Phenomena and National Institute of Comparative Astrobiology, and features drawings, paintings, dioramas, taxidermy and performative photos by artists Rachel Berwick, Sarina Brewer, Walmor Correa, Ellen Lesperance, Robert Marbury, Jill Miller, Vic Muniz, Jeanine Oleson, Rosamond Purcell, Alexis Rockman, Marc Swanson, Jeffrey Vallance and Jamie Wyeth.</p><p></p><h2>Isuzu Rodeo, Amigo, &amp; Honda Passport covering Isuzu Rodeo (91-02), Isuzu Amigo (89-94), Isuzu Amigo (98-02), Honda Passport (95-02) Haynes Repair Manual (Haynes Manuals)</h2><p>Inside this manual you will find routine maintenance, tune-up procedures, engine repair, cooling and heating, air conditioning, fuel and exhaust, emissions control, ignition, brakes, suspension and steering, electrical systems, and wiring diagrams.</p><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Cott, author of <i>The Bonds of Womanhood, </i>offers a new interpretation of American feminism during the early decades of this century&#x2015;a period traditionally viewed as on in which women won the right to vote and then lost interest in feminist issues. Cott argues instead that his period was a time of crisis and transition from the nineteenth-century "woman movement&#x2019; to the beginning of modern feminism. Many of the issues that are central to women today, says Cott, were firmly articulated in the early decades of this century. For example, the problem of defining sexual equality so as to recognize sexual difference between men and women, the ambiguous potential of a movement seeking individual freedoms for women by mobilizing sex solidarity, and the tensions involved in attaining full expression in work and love are all enduring elements of feminism seized upon by women of the 1910s and 1920s. <br>First discussing how feminism was indebted to its predecessors, Cott shows that increasing heterogeneity and diverse loyalties among women in the early twentieth century contradicted the premise of the nineteenth-century "cause of woman" (the singular noun symbolizing the unity of the female sex). From this crisis emerged feminism, championing individual variability and refuting the premise that a singular "woman" existed. <br>Cott focuses on the suffrage-campaign milieu in which feminism arose, giving particular attention to the character and role of the National Woman&#x2019;s Party from its militant suffrage days to its advocacy of the equal right amendment in the 1920s. Against prevailing interpretations of the decline of women&#x2019;s political activities after 1920, Cott counterposes the swelling numbers in women&#x2019;s voluntary associations and their political efforts. She also analyzes the pitfalls that awaited women who tried for effectiveness in the male-dominated political parties. She sets the controversy over the equal rights amendment in new context, discussing the full dimensions of the conflict as not merely over personalities, tactics, or class loyalties, but as a signal example of the modern problem of capturing sexual equality and sexual difference in law. <br>The book explores the irony-strewn path of women who as aspiring professionals and political actors attempted to put into practice the feminist intent to replace the abstraction "woman" with, instead, "the human sex." This history&#x2015;the story of women who first claimed the name feminists&#x2015;builds an essential bridge between the presuffrage period and today.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>In this landmark addition to scholarship, Nancy F.

It should both enthuse and guide the beginning researcher while providing support to the more experienced scholar.&nbsp; A required textbook for the social science bookshelf.&nbsp;</p> Author: Michael Murray<br><br><p>This is a clearly written, step-by-step guide that will help those carrying out a first social research project a great deal, and which will also be used by more experienced practitioners to supplement their knowledge. The author&#x2019;s own experience of research projects, and of teaching methods, is extensive. He draws on this to provide invaluable guidance, covering all the main approaches likely to be of use in carrying out a project, at a level that is at once accessible and impressively practical. I look forward to recommending this book to my students.&nbsp;</p> Author: Clive Seale<br><br>This book provides an extremely useful guide to the basics of research, such as the fundamental characteristics of quantitative and qualitative research and their associated research questions. It is written in an accessible style without the complicated use of terms and details that often shroud research methods books. It is orientated toward the beginner who may not be familiar with the language of quantitative and qualitative research and who may be an undergraduate in the social sciences. It balances nicely attention to both quantitative and qualitative research, providing legitimacy for both approaches.<br> Author: John Creswell</p><h2>Doing Naturalistic Inquiry: A Guide to Methods</h2><p><p>Based on the theoretical work of Lincoln and Guba, this practical text is designed to help new researchers apply the constructivist paradigm. The authors show how these ideas shape the practice of conducting alternative paradigm research. Covering the research process from design, through data-collection analysis and presentation, as well as important issues generally minimized in positivist research texts - ethics, trustworthiness and authenticity - cases from a wide variety of disciplines demonstrate the efficacy of the methods described. </p></p><p>"This book is as good a practical guide to naturalistic inquiry as one could hope for at this time. It is clear, it is practical, it is stimulating, it leads, it guides, it inspires. The authors provide action-based legitimation for naturalistic inquiry. If the question, &#x2032;It all sounds good, but does it work?&#x2032; is a reasonable one to pose, this book demonstrates that naturalistic inquiry works. The authors are to be congratulated for a splendid contribution." Author: from the Foreword by Egon G.

Byatt (Everyman&#39;s Library Contemporary Classics Series)</h2><p><p>Introduction by A. S. Byatt</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Willa Cather&#x2019;s story of the missionary priest Father Jean Marie Latour and his work of faith in the wilderness of the Southwest is told with a spare but sensuous directness and profound artistry. When Latour arrives in 1851 in the territory of New Mexico, newly acquired by the United States, what he finds is a vast desert region of red hills and tortured arroyos that is American by law but Mexican and Indian in custom and belief. Over the next four decades, Latour works gently and tirelessly to spread his faith and to build a soaring cathedral out of the local golden rock&#x2014;while contending with unforgiving terrain, derelict and sometimes rebellious priests, and his own loneliness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP shares a limitless, craggy beauty with the New Mexico landscape of desert, mountain, and canyon in which its central action takes place, and its evocations of that landscape and those who are drawn to it suggest why Cather is acknowledged without question as the most poetically exact chronicler of the American frontier.</p></p><p>Death Comes for the Archbishop sprang from Willa Cather&#39;s love for the land and cultures of the American Southwest. Published in 1927 to both praise and perplexity, it has since claimed for itself a major place in twentieth-century literature. The narrative follows Bishop Jean Latour and Father Joseph Vaillant, friends since their childhood in France, as they organize the new Roman Catholic diocese of Santa Fe subsequent to the Mexican War. While seeking to revive the church and build a cathedral in the desert, the clerics, like their historical prototypes, Bishop Jean Laury and Father Joseph Machebeuf, face religious corruption, natural adversity, and the loneliness of living in a strange and unforgiving land. The historical essay traces the artistic and spiritual development that led to its writing. The broad-ranging explanatory notes illuminate the elements of French, Mexican, Hispanic, and Native American cultures that meet in the course of the narrative, they also explain the part played by the land and its people - their history, religion, art, and languages.by A. S. Byatt</p><h2>Secrets of the I Ching</h2><p>The classic guide to tapping the practical benefits of an age-old book of wisdom--revised to captivate today's spiritual seekers <p> Based on the revered Chinese philosophy with a 5,000-year-old tradition, the I Ching, or Book of Changes, is rich in revelations.

But it does provide the tools to mark any future with the promise of greater personal and spiritual fulfillment.</p></p><p>A native of Ireland, Joseph Murphy (1898 &#x2014; 1981) was a prolific and widely admired New Thought minister and writer, best known for his motivational classic, <i>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind</i>, an international bestseller since it first blazed onto the self-help scene. His pamphlet <i>How to Attract Money</i> first appeared in 1955, and likewise entered many editions.

Two thousand years after it occurred, many compelling questions remain about his death: Was Brutus the hero and Caesar the villain? Did Caesar bring death on himself by planning to make himself king of Rome? Was Mark Antony aware of the plot, and let it go forward? Who wrote Antony's script after Caesar's death? Using historical evidence to sort out these and other puzzling issues, historian and award-winning author Stephen Dando-Collins takes you to the world of ancient Rome and recaptures the drama of Caesar's demise and the chaotic aftermath as the vicious struggle for power between Antony and Octavian unfolded. For the first time, he shows how the religious festivals and customs of the day impacted on the way the assassination plot unfolded. He shows, too, how the murder was almost avoided at the last moment.</p><p>A compelling history that is packed with intrigue and written with the pacing of a first-rate mystery, <i>The Ides</i> will challenge what you think you know about Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire.</p></p><p><p>Sixty killers, wearing the purple-trimmed togas of Roman senators, unsheathed their hidden daggers to stab the most feared and powerful man in the Empire. Hundreds of their colleagues ran screaming from the Theater of Pompey the Great, proclaiming the bloody deed to the thousands of citizens who clogged the streets outside. It was the most public of crimes. Yet, two millennia after the murder of Julius Caesar, many questions remain unanswered. Was Brutus a treasonous villain or a hero of Rome? Were the killers motivated by noble sentiment or venality? Why did so many of Caesar's formerly loyal lieutenants take part in the murder? </p><p>In The Ides, celebrated author and classical researcher Stephen Dando-Collins transports you to the streets, palaces, and gathering places of ancient Rome to experience a richly detailed, convincingly accurate, and stunningly suspenseful account of Caesar's final days. He traces the conspiracy that brought the conqueror down, from a surprising holiday meeting between Cassius and Brutus to its chaotic conclusion and beyond.</p><p>Drawing deeply from ancient manuscripts, Dando-Collins documents Caesar's campaign to persuade the Senate, which had already declared him a "living god," to appoint him king of Rome before his planned departure on a military mission on March 19, 44 b.c. He reveals why many Romans already considered Caesar a tyrant and why Brutus, who may well have been Caesar's illegitimate son, felt a special obligation to depose this man who would be king. </p><p>This compelling history follows the mercurial Cassius and even-tempered Brutus as they carefully feel out potential co-conspirators, knowing that one wrong choice could be their last. It reveals the dramatic lengths to which Brutus's wife Porcia went to prove he could trust her with his secret; why Caesar, even as the killers paced in restless anticipation of his arrival, canceled the Senate session he had called; and how a close associate convinced him to change his mind. </p><p>Complete with a thoughtful analysis of why the plotters failed in their aim to restore the Republic and a chilling account of the deadly power struggles that continued for years after Caesar's death, The Ides is "must reading" for anyone fascinated with the Roman Empire, military history, and an incredibly good tale well told.</p><p>Stephen Dando-Collins is an Australian-born historian and award-winning author who has spent more than three decades studying the individual legions of the Roman army of the late Republic and the empire of the Caesars. He is the author of Caesar's Legion: The Epic Saga of Julius Caesar's Elite Tenth Legion and the Armies of Rome, Nero's Killing Machine: The True Story of Rome's Remarkable Fourteenth Legion, Cleopatra's Kidnappers: How Caesar's Sixth Legion Gave Egypt to Rome and Rome to Caesar, Mark Antony's Heroes: How the Third Gallica Legion Saved an Apostle and Created an Emperor, and Blood of the Caesars: How the Murder of Germanicus Led to the Fall of Rome. </p></p><h2>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)</h2><p>A mysterious young widow calling herself Helen Graham arrives at Wildfell Hall and immediately arouses her new neighbors' suspicions with her unconventional opinions and the attention she draws from the local bachelors. One of her admirers, a farmer named Gilbert Markham, readily offers his friendship but has second thoughts about Helen's reclusive conduct and the gossip it excites. When Helen allows Gilbert to read her diary, he discovers the reason behind her secretive behavior &#x2014; a disastrous marriage to a ne'er-do-well, whom she ultimately flees in defiance of the legal lack of rights for wives. <br>An instant bestseller upon publication under the pseudonym Acton Bell, Anne Bront�'s book was later suppressed by her eldest surviving sister, Charlotte, because of its unorthodox content. Written with a realism that scandalized critics in its portrayal of adultery, alcoholism, and marital discord, this compelling tale has been hailed as one of the first major works of feminist literature.</p><p><p> Anne Bront�&#x2019;s second and last novel was widely and contentiously reviewed upon its 1848 publication, in part because its subject matter domestic violence, alcoholism, women&#x2019;s rights, and universal salvation was so controversial. The tale unfolds through a series of letters between two friends as one man learns more about Helen Huntingdon and the past that brought this young painter and single mother to Wildfell Hall. Powerfully plotted and unconventionally structured, <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> is now considered to be a classic of Victorian literature. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition includes a critical introduction that situates the novel in significant Victorian debates, and provides appendices that make clear Bront�&#x2019;s intellectual inheritance from important eighteenth-century writers such as Hannah More and Mary Wollstonecraft. Material on temperance, education, childrearing, and nineteenth-century women artists is also included in the appendices. </p>Anne Bront� (1820&#x2013;49), the youngest of the famous sisters, drew upon her experiences as a governess to write her first novel, <i>Agnes Grey.</i> Her second, <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,</i> was partly inspired by her dissolute brother, and she died from tuberculosis a year after its publication. Despite its popularity, Charlotte Bront� suppressed the book's republication, leaving it to be rediscovered as an early feminist classic.</p><h2>The Backcountry Classroom: Lessons, Tools, and Activities for Teaching Outdoor Leaders</h2><p>This unique collection of lessons represents not only the fundamentals but the very foundation of leadership and outdoor skills.

Sadly, the majority of his short stories have been unavailable for some time. Now this welcome volume, the first of three, brings together more than 40 stories written between 1895 and 1926, including <i>The Riddle and Other Stories, Ding Dong Bell, The Connoisseur and Other Stories, Kismet,</i> and 14 other previously uncollected pieces.</p><p>Walter de la Mare (1873-1956) was one of the leading poets and novelists of the twentieth century. His writings are known throughout the world, and have been translated into numerous languages. He wrote poetry and fiction for both adults and children. He is loved and admired equally by the young and the old. Together with the Complete Poems, published in 1969 and shortly to be brought back into print -- and also edited by Giles de la Mare -- Short Stories I, II and III provide the definitive text of Walter de la Mare&#39;s creative writings.

Since then it has sold over 330,000 copies in the United States alone.<br> But the <em>Compact</em> did not contain the <em>Supplements to the OED</em> which have been appearing at regular intervals since 1972. Now, with their completion in 1986, all four volumes are being produced in a single micrographically reproduced volume to be called Volume III of the <em>Compact OED</em>. So the vital addendum, which transforms the <em>OED</em> into an indispensable tool for the eighties, will be made available for the first time in this convenient and affordable format.<br> The <em>Supplement</em>, called the "book of the century" by Phillip Howard in the London <em>Times</em>, contains all the new words that have come into use during the twentieth century and includes as well the countless new meanings that have been applied to older words--over 69,000 entries altogether. It includes business terms, "computerese," space-age terminology, colloquialisms and coinages by modern authors ranging from William Faulkner and Virginia Woolf to Gore Vidal and Erica Jong. Words like <em>G-man</em>, <em>yuppie</em>, <em>user-friendly</em> , <em>test-tube baby</em>, and <em>Zen Buddhism</em> rub shoulders with the most recent additions to subjects like law, medicine and engineering. The wealth of Americanisms in the <em>Supplement</em> also reflects a new direction for the dictionary. As editor Robert Burchfield explains it, "The center of gravity for the English language is no longer Britain. American English is the greatest influence on English everywhere."<br> Volume III of the <em>Compact</em> is available in its own jndividual slipcase or combined with Volumes I and II in one slipcase.

Why did so many railroad mergers in the 1950s and 1960s, intended as a panacea for the ills of an outdated system, go sour and, in fact, make a bad situation worse? Saunders addresses these and many other issues in this authoritative history of U.S. railroads and their corporate mergers. <br><br>Beginning with a wide-ranging analysis of the role of railroads in the economic and social fabric of American life, Saunders traces the causes and results of the twentieth century's "merger mania." Mergers, he explains, were expected to save money, to improve service to customers, and to help railroads compete against other modes of transportation, such as the growing airline and trucking industries. Saunders then gives colorful, richly detailed accounts of the mergers and shows the reasons&#x2014;including corporate greed and the inept blundering of government regulatory agencies&#x2014;the outcomes fell far short of expectations. <br><br><i>Merging Lines</i> explores the impact of shifting political control of railroads as no history has done before. The fates of both workers and railroad companies were dictated by the rise and fall of business and governmental leaders, including Bill Brosnan, Robert R. Young, Alfred Perlman, President John F. Kennedy, and President Lyndon B. Johnson. As power struggles erupted, the original goals of the mergers were thwarted by consumer frustration, violent labor strikes, and organizational collapse. Saunders explores these and other crucial developments in this extensive work, carefully designed for railroad historians and enthusiasts at any level. <br><br>Encyclopedic in its scope, <i>Merging Lines</i> includes sixty-eight maps, a list of court cases involving railroad mergers, and a wealth of information on American railroads from coast to coast. An extensively revised, updated, and supplemented edition of Saunders's earlier classic, <i>The Railroad Mergers and the Coming of Conrail</i> (1978), it is essential reading for all who are interested in railroad and transportation history.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Saunders Jr.</b> is professor emeritus of history at Clemson University.

In 1945 he published a radical new classification of Blues, a paper that initially caused a stir in the rarified field of lepidoptery. However, it was fifty years before scientists followed up on his pioneering work. Part biography and part detective story, <i>Nabokov's Blues</i> explores the rich and varied place butterflies hold in Nabokov's fiction, as well as far-reaching questions of biogeography and evolution, and the worldwide crisis of ecology and biodiversity.<br><br>"A view of Nabokov's science and art that is both eerily evocative and stunningly new, that makes delectable reading without patronizing the reader."-Dmitri Nabokov<br><br>"Vivid and varied, surprising and thoughtful, wry and poignant, <i>Nabokov's Blues</i> will appeal to anyone with a taste for adventure and contrast."-Brian Boyd<br><br><b>Chapter: The Most Famous Lepidopterist in the World</b><br><br>"Frankly, I never thought of letters as a career. Writing has always been for me a blend of dejection and high spirits, a torture and a pastime-but I never expected it to be a source of income. On the other hand, I have often dreamt of a long and exciting career as an obscure curator of lepidoptera in a great museum..."-Vladimir Nabokov, <i>Strong Opinions</i><br><br>Lepidoptery, the branch of science dedicated to the study of butterflies and moths, has its own legendary figures, and its history is both long and glorious. But for lepidopterists, as in fact for most entomologists, the light of celebrity seldom shines outside a narrow but passionate circle of scientists and collectors.<br><br>During the Age of Exploration, when the influx of exotic new plants and animals from the four corners of a seemingly boundless globe astounded Europe, the study of biology, often a preserve of the well-born, offered a path to wealth and fame. Sir Joseph Banks, the 18th century English biologist who accompanied Captain James Cook on his three-year circumnavigation aboard the British ship Endeavor, was a friend of King George III and one of the most fam</p><p>The title <i>Nabokov's Blues</i> is sure to bewilder many: was the great author depressed? Nothing of the sort--unknown to all but the most dedicated <i>Lolita</i>-philes, the great Russian author was a dedicated lepidopterist; the book, by fellow scientist Kurt Johnson and writer Steve Coates, explores his life's work with the Blue butterflies of South America. Nabokov brought the same gentle sensibility to his scientific work that he used in his writing and teaching careers, and the authors have found great new depths to the man that an army of biographers had failed to excavate. Entomology buffs will find much to love in <i>Nabokov's Blues</i>, with collecting trips into the field and anatomical detective work taking the forefront. Literati seeking new insights into the man's life will also be pleased to find his story told from a new perspective, focusing more on his exacting research than his tumultuous personal life.<p> Nabokov's life reflects 20th-century biology as well as literature; he involved himself in many of the great debates of his time from his vantage points at Cornell and Harvard (where he held a post at the Museum of Comparative Zoology). His contributions to our thinking about speciation, some of which have only come to light recently, are clear-headed and invaluable. The authors know Nabokov's life well and are eager to share this side of it with us; while he will always be better known for his literary work, <i>Nabokov's Blues</i> throws light into the shadows cast by his great stature. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"This insidiously charming book teaches readers about the place of lepidoptery in the life sciences and the kinds of questions that natural scientists seek to answer... Like Nabokov himself, this volume exemplifies some of the virtues shared by art and science: wit, intelligence, and, above all, meticulousness."--"The New Yorker<p>"Charming...In a world that often separates science and culture like church and state, this book reminds us that, for Nabokov, butterflies helped shape 'a habitual way of looking at the world' that was ultimately conducive to great literature and to great lepidoptery alike."--"New York Times Book Review</p><p>"This is a grand book: erudite, generous, and wise.

The development of such key ideas as religion, science, and philosophy form the central narrative of this book.<br><br><em>The Cultures of the West </em>stands apart from other textbooks in a variety of ways, the first being thematic unity. What did people think and believe, throughout our history, about human nature, the right way to live, God, the best forms of government, or the meaning of human life? Rather than maintaining a single interpretive stance, author Clifford R. Backman relies upon a consistent set of questions: What did people think and feel throughout the centuries about politics, science, religion, and sex? How did they come to their positions regarding the right way to live? Backman's many years of experience in the classroom have informed his approach-students respond to engaging questions more than they are inspired by facts.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><strong>* Single author voice:</strong> clearly and compellingly written by an experienced teacher and scholar who knows how to emphasize intriguing and eye-opening elements of Western Civilization<br><strong>* A book with a point of view: </strong>even if disagreed with, the text will at engage students' minds<br><strong>* Exceptional coverage of cultural history</strong>, especially the history of what people thought and felt throughout the history of the West<br><strong>*</strong> <strong>"Greater West" approach </strong>that integrates in sustained fashion coverage of Islam and the Middle East<br><strong>*</strong> <strong>Superior coverage</strong> of Jewish history and the history of women<br><strong>*</strong> <strong>Extensive primary source excerpts</strong> integrated directly into the text, many of which have been translated by the author<br>* <strong>Footnotes </strong>featuring surprising, engaging information usually neglected in other texts</p><p><br><strong>Clifford R.

Written by an author of great repute. The history of the 20th century is Marx&#39;s legacy. Not since Jesus Christ has an obscure pauper inspired such global devotion -- or been so calamitously misinterpreted. The end of the century is a good moment to strip away the mythology and try to rediscover Marx the man. There have been many thousands of books on Marxism, but almost all are written by academics and zealots for whom it is a near blaspemy to treat him as a figure of flesh and blood. In the past few years there have been excellent and successful biographies of many eminent Victorians and yet the most influential of them has remained untouched. In this book Francis Wheen, for the first time, presens Marx the man in all his brilliance and frailty -- as a poverty-stricken Prussian emigre who became a middle-class English gentleman; as an angry agitator who spent much of his adult life in scholarly silence in the British Museum Reading Room; as a gregarious and convivial host who fell out with almost all his friends; as a devoted family man who impregnated his housemaid; as a deeply earnest philosopher</p><p>Karl Marx, whose influence on modern times has been compared to that of Jesus Christ, spent most of his lifetime in obscurity. Penniless, exiled in London, estranged from relations, and on the run from most of the police forces of Europe, his ambitions as a revolutionary were frequently thwarted, and his major writings on politics and economics remained unpublished (in some cases until after the Second World War). He has not lacked biographers, but even the most distinguished have been more interested in the evolution of his ideas than any other aspect of his life. Francis Wheen's fresh, lively, and moving biography of Marx considers the whole man--brain, beard, and the rest of his body. Unencumbered by ideological point scoring, this is a very readable, humorous, and sympathetic account. Wheen has an ear for juicy gossip and an eye for original detail. Marx comes across as a hell-raising bohemian, an intellectual bully, and a perceptive critic of capitalist chaos, but also a family man of Victorian conformity (personally vetting his daughters' suitors), Victorian ailments (carbuncles above all), and Victorian weaknesses (notably alcohol, tobacco, and, on occasion, his housekeeper). But there is great pathos, too, as Marx witnessed the deaths of four of his six children. For those readers who feel Marxism has given Marx a bad name, this is a rewarding and enlightening book. <i>--Miles Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i>Francis Wheen is a distinguished author and journalist who was voted Columnist of the Year in February 1997 for his weekly column in the Guardian. He has written several books including the highly acclaimed biography of Tom Driberg MP, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread prize.</p><h2>Harrison&#39;s Principles of Internal Medicine, 17th Edition</h2><p><p><b>Introducing the most dramatically revised edition of <i>Harrison's</i> ever!</b></p> <p><i><b>Now with NEW bonus DVD with 37 chapters and more than 500 brand new images and video clips!</b></i></p> <p><b>A Doody's Core Title ESSENTIAL PURCHASE!</b></p> <p><b>5 STAR DOODY'S REVIEW</b><br> "The book is for anyone who has the remotest association with the practice of medicine, be they internists, surgeons, nurses, technical staff, or counselors.

Other health professional students and practitioners may also benefit from this book, including pathology residents, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. This text replaces Textbook of Hematology published by Lea &amp; Febiger in 1988 and by Williams &amp; Wilkins in 1996. However this text should be considered as a brand new publication because of its wide variety of changes and enhancements. Included among these changes are the following: we have assembled an extensive team of authoritative contributing authors to write chapters on specialized subjects within their respective fields of expertise; we have developed a striking design that will be conducive to today's visually oriented student; we have developed an exciting set of learning features that will help readers grasp the content more easily; we have developed a book-specific online study guide (wwwprenhall.com/mckenzie); and finally, we have packaged the text with a free student version of the Chronolab CD-ROM photomicrograph atlas. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK</b></p> <p> Understanding hematologic/hemostatic diseases is dependent on a thorough knowledge and understanding of normal processes. Thus, the book begins with a section on normal hematopoiesis and progresses through anemias, nonmalignant and malignant leukocyte disorders. Hemostasis adheres to a similar format with normal hemostasis functions discussed first, followed by abnormalities in hemostasis. </p> <p> The text is divided into sections and maybe studied by section or chapter sequence. This gives the instructor flexibility td fit the book to their specific course design. The first two sections cover an introduction to hematology and normal hematopoiesis. This includes a discussion of the cell morphology, cell cycle, and its regulation. The section includes a discussion on oncogenes emphasizing the concept that neoplasms are the result of mutations in normal genes that control cell proliferation and development. This concept is further discussed in the introduction to hematopoietic neoplasms. The third section, includes procedures that are routine and performed in most laboratories. These are included at the beginning of the book so the students will have basic laboratory test information as they proceed through the subsequent chapters on hematopoietic disorders which focus on laboratory diagnostic protocols. </p> <p> The next sections cover the hematopoietic disorders and special laboratory procedures. The fourth section includes the anemias and begins with an introduction to anemia chapter. The fifth section is nonmalignant disorders of the leukocytes. The sixth section includes a discussion of special laboratory procedures that are useful in diagnosis and classification of hematopoietic neoplasms: flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular diagnostics. This section may be studied before or after the seventh section on neoplastic hematopoietic disorders, depending on the reader's knowledge level of the neoplasms. If this is the reader's first exposure to the neoplasms, it may be better to cover section 7 before section 6. Alternatively, sections 6 and 7 can be integrated and studied together. </p> <p> Section 8 is a study of body fluids. Body fluid analysis is often a function of the hematology laboratory, since analysis includes cell counts and review of cell morphology. As much of the analysis includes identification of cells and differentiation of malignant cells from reactive or normal cells, this section has many microphotographs. </p> <p> Section 9 is a study of hemostasis. It begins with a study of normal hemostasis processes and proceeds to abnormalities that are associated with bleeding and thrombosis. Due to the high frequency of thrombotic disorders and the rapid discovery of mechanisms responsible for thrombosis, the laboratory's role in diagnosis of thrombotic disorders is expanding. Thus, an entire chapter is devoted to hypercoagulability (thrombophilia). This section also includes laboratory testing procedures for evaluation of hemostasis. </p> <p> The last section includes special hematology procedures and quality assurance and safety in the laboratory. Automation in hematology and hemostasis will be supplemented on the Web page with extensive use of graphics to illustrate abnormal results and teach evaluation and interpretation of data. </p> <p> The book incorporates ethical issues and management issues of test utilization and value, as well as critical testing pathways. This is the soft side of science but alerts the students to issues they will be facing in their work and communities. In many cases the laboratorian is the one who has the breadth of information needed to help make critical decisions involving the laboratory and its effective, efficient, ethical use. </p> <p><b>SUITS ALL LEVELS OF LEARNING</b></p> <p> This book has been designed for both CLT/MLT and CLS/MT students. Using only one textbook is beneficial and economical in laboratory science programs offering both levels. Use of the book is also helpful to programs that design articulated curricula. The CLS/MT program can be confident of the CLT's/MLT's knowledge level in hematology without doing an extensive CLT/MLT course analysis. </p> <p> CLT/MLT instructors will need to communicate to their students what is expected of them. They may want their students to find the information in the text that allows them to satisfy the checklist, or they may assign particular sections to read. If not assigned specific sections, the CLT/MLT student may read more than expected which is certainly not a bad thing! The students and instructors should use the checklists to determine the material to be read. </p> <p> The case study questions and checkpoints are not delineated by level. CLT/MLT students should try to answer as many of these as possible. CLT/MLT instructors should select appropriate chapters for their students. Some chapters, such as molecular techniques, cytogenetics, and flow cytometry may not be included in a CLT/MLT curriculum. Each program will need to assess what fits its particular curriculum. </p> <p> CLS/MT students should be able to meet both Level I and Level II checklists in most cases, but of course there may be differences among expectations of programs. Therefore, instructors are encouraged to review the checklists to ensure their appropriateness for the course. Although all chapters are appropriate for the CLS/MT student, if the program has two levels of hematology courses, Level I and Level II, instructors may choose to use the book as for a CLT/MLT program in the first course and the remainder of the book in the second course. </p> <p> In all cases the instructor should begin the course with sections 1 through 3. The remaining sections can be rearranged and used as the instructor desires. The "Background Basics" feature will help the instructor determine which concepts the student should have mastered before beginning a unit of study. This concept should help instructors customize their courses. </p> <p><b>UNIQUE PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES</b></p> <p> This text has a number of unique pedagogical features that will help the student assimilate, organize, and understand the information. Each chapter begins with a group of components intended to set the stage for the content to follow. </p> <ul> <li>Background Basics alert students to material that should be learned or reviewed before starting the chapter. In most cases it refers readers to previous chapters to help them find the material if they want to review it.</li> <li>Objectives are comprised of two levels of checklists: Level I for basic or essential information and Level II for more advanced information. These checklists were reviewed by clinical (medical) laboratory technician (CLT/MLT) educators who made recommendations that aimed the Level I checklists to their students. Clinical laboratory science/medical technologist (CLS/MT) educators may expect their students to meet both Level I and Level II checklists requirements.</li> <li>Overview gives the reader an idea of the chapter content and organization.</li> </ul> <p> Each chapter offers students a variety of opportunities to assess their knowledge and ability to apply it. </p> <ul> <li>Case Study is a running case feature that first appears at the beginning of each chapter and focuses the student's attention on the subject matter that the chapter will cover. Throughout the chapter at appropriate places, additional information on the case may be given such as laboratory test results, and then questions are asked. The questions relate to the material presented in preceding sections. There is a case summary and answers to the questions in the appendix.</li> <li>Checkpoints! are integrated throughout the chapter. These are questions that require the student to pause along the way to recall or apply information covered in preceding sections. The answers are in the appendix.</li> <li>Summary concludes the text portion of each chapter in order to help the student bring all the material together.</li> <li>Review Questions appear at the end of each chapter. There are two sets of questions, Level I and Level II, that are referenced to the Level I and Level II objectives checklists. Answers are in the appendix.</li> </ul> <p> The page design features a number of enhancements intended to aid the learning process. </p> <ul> <li><b>Bold symbols</b> are used within the chapter text to help the student quickly cross-reference from the tables and figures to the text.</li> <li><b>A oo symbol</b> is also used when referring the student to another chapter.</li> <li><b>Figures and tables</b> are used liberally to help the student organize and conceptualize information.

The book explores key debates on devolution, participation and democracy; the role and uniqueness of indigenous peoples and other local communities; institutions and resource management; hegemony, myth and symbolic power in conservation success stories; tourism, poverty and conservation; and the transformation of social and material relations which community conservation entails. For conservation practitioners and protected area professionals not accustomed to criticisms of their work, or students new to this complex field, the book will provide an understanding of the history and current state of affairs in the rise of protected areas. It introduces the concepts, theories and writers on which critiques of conservation have been built, and provides the means by which practitioners can understand problems with which they are wrestling. For advanced researchers the book will present a critique of the current debates on protected areas and provide a host of jumping off points for an array of research avenues</p><p>Daniel Brockington is Senior Lecturer at the Institute for Development Policy and Management, Manchester University, UK.

Nature Unbound does more than summarize its history and characteristics; it also, crucially, transcends the contention by analysing conservation in terms that will re-shape the debate. The authors ask about the gains and losses of conservation, and how they are distributed. In answering these questions, they offer a persuasive description of the institutions and practices of conservation in an unequal, capitalist world.' James G. Carrier, Oxford Brookes University and Indiana University 'This is an exciting book that summarises the debates about conservation with clarity and depth, but takes them several stages further to confront the reader to recognise the many ways in which conservation practices shape and are shaped by contemporary capitalism. It deserves to be read in New Zealand, where conservation, like anywhere else, is anything but unproblematic. It is, however, frequently constructed as such: to the extent that we seem often to lack the analytical tools to engage in proper debate. In contrast, this book provides plenty.' New Zealand Geographer</p> <p>'Due to its wide range of topics, Nature Unbound is an excellent introduction to critical perspectives on conservation. Furthermore, the organization of every chapter makes it possible to read each of them separately without losing sight of the central argument.' &#x2013; Alejandro Camargo, PhD candidate in Geography, Syracuse University</p></p><h2>Gene Wars: Military Control over the New Genetic Technologies</h2><p>Describes the prospects for the development and use of genetically engineered biological warfare, examines the U.S. military biotechnology program, and discusses the future of genetic arms control</p><p>This book is an in-depth probe of the frightening new era of genetic technology and the threat of an emerging biological arms race. Investigative journalist Pillar and molecular biologist Yamamoto present in intelligent language a complex problem of policy, science, and law. They provide a devastating analysis of the military's use of deception and secrecy to avoid governmental control and to manipulate an all-too-cooperative industry in developing chemical and biological weapons and Frankensteinian supertoxins and diseases. High marks go to their coverage of the historical development and use of chemical and biological warfare (CBW), the law and policy of CBW treaties, the future of genetic arms control, and the call for a new agenda of action. Designed for informed readers, but deserves attention from academicians and policy makers. Clifton E.

Today computing finds its way into our pockets, our cars, our appliances; it is ubiquitous&#x2015;an inescapable part of our everyday lives. Computing is even expanding beyond our devices; sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators are increasingly embedded into the built environment. In <i>Architectural Robotics</i>, Keith Evan Green looks toward the next frontier in computing: interactive, partly intelligent, meticulously designed physical environments. Green examines how these &#x201c;architectural robotic&#x201d; systems will support and augment us at work, school, and home, as we roam, interconnect, and age.</p><p>Green tells the stories of three projects from his research lab that exemplify the <i>reconfigurable</i>, <i>distributed</i>, and <i>transfigurable</i> environments of architectural robotics. The Animated Work Environment is a robotic work environment of shape-shifting physical space that responds dynamically to the working life of the people within it; home+ is a suite of networked, distributed &#x201c;robotic furnishings&#x201d; integrated into existing domestic and healthcare environments; and LIT ROOM offers a simulated environment in which the physical space of a room merges with the imaginary space of a book, becoming &#x201c;a portal to elsewhere.&#x201d;</p><p>How far beyond workstations, furniture, and rooms can the environments of architectural robotics stretch? Green imagines scaled-up neighborhoods, villages, and metropolises composed of physical bits, digital bytes, living things, and their hybrids. Not global but local, architectural robotics grounds computing in a capacious cyber-physical home. </p></p><p>Keith Evan Green is Professor of Design + Environmental Analysis and Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University.<p>No more Jetsons technofuturism!

Why is Learning Cursive: Handwriting Practice Workbook for Teens an important addition to your teen&#x2019;s curriculum? According to a 2013 New York Times article, &#x201c;Learning to write in cursive is shown to improve brain development in the areas of thinking, language and working memory. Cursive handwriting stimulates brain synapses and synchronicity between the left and right hemispheres, something absent from printing and typing. As a result, the physical act of writing in cursive leads to increased comprehension and participation. The College Board found that students who wrote in cursive for the essay portion of the SAT scored slightly higher than those who printed.&#x201d; These cursive writing worksheets are perfect for helping teens improve cursive penmanship. Learning Cursive: Handwriting Practice Workbook for Teens is a great resource for the homeschool classroom as well as public and private 1st grade, 2nd grade, and 3rd grade classrooms.

The vocabulary ... is not too difficult, and the literary style is almost conversational."<br><br>"The faculty who adopted Spielvogel ... did so because the text read clearly and told a coherent story of historical change and development. Students comment that the text is well written, clearly organized, and interesting.

Environmentalists considered it a disaster and mourned Glen Canyon as gone forever. The Sierra Club joined forces with photographer Eliot Porter to document what would be lost under the dam&#x2019;s waters, resulting in the publication of the landmark 1963 photobook <i>The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado</i>.<p></p><p>But in an unexpected victory that speaks to the pervasive disaster of climate change, the reservoir is now declining and the Colorado River is coming back. Photographers Byron Wolfe (born 1967) and Mark Klett (born 1952), along with writer Rebecca Solnit (born 1961), spent five years exploring the place as expectations and possibilities changed, and the river reemerged at the upper end of the reservoir. </p><p>In dialogue with Porter&#x2019;s book, Klett and Wolfe retraced the physical locations where Porter made his photographs, now often submerged by the reservoir&#x2019;s waters. Solnit&#x2019;s accompanying text meditates on the meanings and histories of the place, drawing from both the trio&#x2019;s explorations and archival research.</p><p><i>Drowned River</i> is a book about climate change, about &#x201c;the madness of the past and the terror of the future&#x201d; (as Solnit puts it). But it is also a book about how photography can describe beauty and trouble simultaneously, and what it takes to understand a place and to come to terms with the changes we have set in motion.</p></p><p>Porter&#x2019;s images brought attention to the place, and galvanized the Sierra Club and the growing environmental movement&#x2019;s opposition to similar projects in the future.

Nord and Charles C. Haynes chart a middle course in our culture wars over religion and public education--one that builds on a developing national consensus among educational and religious leaders. While it is not proper for schools to practice religion or proselytize, it is not permissible to make them into "religion-free" zones either; schools must take religion seriously. Unfortunately, religion is taken far from seriously in the K-12 curriculum, as the authors' review of textbooks and the new national content standards makes clear. <p>In Part One Nord and Haynes explain why schools should take religion seriously, and they outline the civic, constitutional, and educational frameworks that should shape the treatment of religion in the curriculum and classroom. In Part Two they explore the major issues relating to religion in different domains of the curriculum_in elementary education, and in middle and high school courses in history, civics, economics, literature, and the sciences. They also discuss Bible courses and world religions courses, and they explore the relationship of religion to moral education and sex education. The result is a book that is unique in the scope of its consideration of the relevance of religion across the curriculum. Anyone interested in the future of public education will find much that is worth considering in this timely, thoughtful, and provocative volume.</p></p><p></p><h2>Conceptual Physics 9th Edition</h2><p><p><b></b> Thirty years ago, this best-selling book defined the "conceptual" approach to introductory physics.

Morial, Esq., President and CEO of the National Urban League</p><h2>The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft</h2><p>Here is a book that brings witchcraft out of the shadows. <em>The Triumph of the Moon</em> is the first full-scale study of the only religion England has ever given the world--modern pagan witchcraft, otherwise known as wicca. Meticulously researched, it provides a thorough account of an ancient religion that has spread from English shores across four continents. <br> For centuries, pagan witchcraft has been linked with chilling images of blood rituals, ghostlike druids, and even human sacrifices. But while Robert Hutton explores this dark side of witchery, he stresses the positive, reminding us that devotion to art, the natural world, femininity, and the classical deities are also central to the practice of wicca. Indeed, the author shows how leading figures in English literature--W.B. Yeats, D.H. Lawrence, and Robert Graves, just to name a few--celebrated these positive aspects of the religion in their work, thereby softening the public perception of witchcraft in Victorian England. From cunning village folk to freemasons and from high magic to the black arts, Hutton chronicles the fascinating process by which actual wiccan practices evolved into what is now a viable modern religion. He also presents compelling biographies of wicca's principal figures, such as Gerald Gardner, who was inducted into a witch coven at the age of 53, and recorded many clandestine rituals and beliefs. <br> Ronald Hutton is known for his colorful, provocative, and always thoroughly researched studies on original subjects. This work is no exception. It will appeal to anyone interested in witchcraft, paganism and alternative religions.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ronald Hutton</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Bristol. He is the author of seven other books, including <em>The Stations of the Sun</em>, which <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> called "a <em>tour de force</em> from one of the liveliest and most wide-ranging English historians." He lives in the United Kingdom.<br>This spirited, amusing and immensely informative history of paganism in 19th- and 20th-century Britain centers on Wicca, the system of witchcraft Gerald B. Gardner introduced to a startled public in the 1950s. The book's first half takes the reader on a breakneck tour of Victorian and Edwardian culture, demonstrating that Wiccan belief and practice owe much to the scholars, novelists and poets who resurrected Pan and the Goddess, crafting romantic visions of a pre-Christian past. The second half proceeds at a more leisurely pace, detailing the development of British witchcraft over the past 50 years among Gardner's followers, critics and rivals. In this meticulously researched book, Hutton modestly demolishes myths perpetuated by both pagans and their hostile critics and maintains an attitude that is at once skeptical and ultimately sympathetic. He displays astounding breadth, with literary references ranging from Keats to Mary Daly, and peppers his work with insightful portraits of characters such as Madam Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, D.H. Lawrence, Dion Fortune, Alex Sanders, Starhawk and the obscure 19th-century wonder-worker and wart-healer known as Cunning Murrell. In a field generally characterized by polemical or apologetic historiography, Hutton's exceptional work is by far the most scholarly, comprehensive and judicious analysis of the subject yet published. It will remain the standard for many years to come. (Feb.) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Systems of Family Therapy: An Adlerian Integration</h2><p>First published in 1987.

A pervasive narrative in everything from school textbooks to political commentary, it is central to the way in which many Americans perceive the historical legacy of their nation. Yet, as Steven K. Green shows in this illuminating new book, it is little more than a myth. <br><br>In <em>Inventing a Christian America</em>, Green, a leading historian of religion and politics, explores the historical record that is purported to support the popular belief in America's religious founding and status as a Christian nation. He demonstrates that, like all myths, these claims are based on historical "facts" that have been colored by the interpretive narratives that have been imposed upon them. In tracing the evolution of these claims and the evidence levied in support of them from the founding of the New England colonies, through the American Revolution, and to the present day, he investigates how they became leading narratives in the country's collective identity. Three critical moments in American history shaped and continue to drive the myth of a Christian America: the Puritan founding of New England, the American Revolution and the forging of a new nation, and the early years of the nineteenth century, when a second generation of Americans sought to redefine and reconcile the memory of the founding to match their religious and patriotic aspirations. Seeking to shed light not only on the veracity of these ideas but on the reasons they endure, Green ultimately shows that the notion of America's religious founding is a myth not merely in the colloquial sense, but also in a deeper sense, as a shared story that gives deeper meaning to our collective national identity. <br><br>Offering a fresh look at one of the most common and contested claims in American history, <em>Inventing a Christian America</em> is an enlightening read for anyone interested in the story of-and the debate over-America's founding.<br></p><p><br><strong>Steven K. Green </strong>is Fred H. Paulus Professor of Law and Director of the Center for Religion, Law, and Democracy at Willamette University. He is the author of <em>The Bible, the School, and the Constitution: The Clash that Shaped Modern Church-State Doctrine</em> and <em>The Second Disestablishment: Church and</em> <em>State in Nineteenth-Century America.</em><br><br>"Green's book is admirably clear, disciplined, and short. It should be required reading for anyone trying to comprehend the perennial Christian America story."--<em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Steven Green's <em>Inventing a Christian America</em> is that rare book where scholarship and sensitivity can calm one of America's most volatile issues. Its breadth and fairness allow understanding and perspective to run ahead of simply inaccurate notions about America's 'Christian foundations.' The result is a marvelously readable account of the fascinating ways religious freedom actually emerged in America and uplifted nation and religion together."--Jon Butler, Howard R. Lamar Professor Emeritus of American Studies, History, and Religious Studies, Yale University <br><p></p><br>"With impressive command of both historical and legal sources, Steven K. Green debunks the durable myth that the United States was founded as a Christian nation. At a time when Baptists have largely abandoned their historic task of patrolling the wall of separation, when Americans pine for what the author characterizes as 'a grand, and uncomplicated, story about the nation's beginnings,' <em>Inventing a Christian America</em> demonstrates that the myth of Christian origins was nineteenth-century invention. In a conversation that typically generates more heat than light, <em>Inventing a Christian America</em> stands out for both its irenic tone and its judicious scholarship."--Randall Balmer, author of <em>Redeemer: The Life of Jimmy Carter</em><p></p><br>"<em>Inventing a Christian America</em> is the most thorough critique of Christian nationalism available today. Steven Green approaches this controversial subject with scholarly insight, a generally irenic spirit, and a comprehensive analysis of the literature produced by those who defend the idea that the United States was founded as a Christian nation. Anyone interested in this subject must read this book."--John Fea, author of <em>Was America Founded as a Christian Nation?: A Historical Introduction</em><p></p><br>"Green helps retrace the steps of an enduring idea to the present day.

Style assigns films to a tradition, distinguishes a classic, and signals the arrival of a pathbreaking innovation. David Bordwell now shows how film scholars have attempted to explain stylistic continuity and change across the history of cinema.</p><p>Bordwell scrutinizes the theories of style launched by Andr� Bazin, No�l Burch, and other film historians. In the process he celebrates a century of cinema, integrating discussions of film classics such as <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> and <i>Citizen Kane</i> with analyses of more current box-office successes such as <i>Jaws</i> and <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>. Examining the contributions of both noted and neglected directors, he considers the earliest filmmaking, the accomplishments of the silent era, the development of Hollywood, and the strides taken by European and Asian cinema in recent years.</p><p><i>On the History of Film Style</i> proposes that stylistic developments often arise from filmmakers' search for engaging and efficient solutions to production problems. Bordwell traces this activity across history through a detailed discussion of cinematic staging. Illustrated with more than 400 frame enlargements, this wide-ranging study provides a new lens for viewing cinema.</p></p><p>David Bordwell is Jacques Ledoux Professor of Film Studies at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.[Bordwell] explains how film scholars have tried to codify stylistic continuity and change over the past 80 years. Beginning with the 'Standard Version' of stylistic history as espoused by Robert Brasillach and Maurice Bardeche, he moves on to treat Andre Bazin, Noel Burch, and more recent research programs...Liberally illustrated with frame enlargements, the book is informative, provocative, and recommended for all libraries. (Neal Baker <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><i>On the History of Film Style</i> is an important addition to the growing body of scholarly work in film historiography. Bordwell's analysis is perceptive and lucid in its discussion of how historians and theorists have sought to explain the changes in film style in the relatively short history of the cinema. It is to the text's advantage that Bordwell utilizes an abundance of frame enlargements to illustrate major points. Above all the book justifies a return to film studies as a humanistic discipline worthy of scholarly pursuit and a continuation for further research programs to be developed through investigative inquiry. (Ronald W. Wilson <i>Institute of Film Studies, Nottingham</i>)<br><br>Bordwell is always sharp and often funny...[He] has a wonderful way of making aesthetic propositions sound plausible while discreetly hinting at what he thinks is their error...[<i>On the History of Film Style</i>] surveys the field [starting] with what he calls 'the Standard Version' of the history of film style...Bordwell next summarizes Bazin's 'dialectical' version of film history...[and] offers a brilliant account of the history of staging in depth, taking us from Meli�s and Porter through Sj�str�m's <i>Ingeborg Holm</i> and Stroheim's <i>Greed</i> to Preminger's <i>Fallen Angel,</i> Cukor's <i>A Star is Born</i> and Speilberg's <i>Jaws.</i> (Michael Wood <i>London Review of Books [UK]</i>)<br><br>Bordwell, the most prolific of film scholars, is certainly not anti-aesthetic. He is, if I may use appreciatively a word that it has been fashionable to use disparagingly, a formalist. In his approach to film style and film history, he takes after such art historians as Heinrich W�lfflin and E.H. Gombrich. At the outset of his latest and perhaps best book, <i>On The History of Film Style</i>, he asks Gombrich's question: 'Why does art have a history?' And though he does not exactly answer the question--neither did Gombrich--at the close he has earned the right to assert with some pride: 'There are people who can look at a film and say with good accuracy when and where it was made.' In the book's last chapter he takes a sustained look at an issue dear to Bazin, staging in depth, and gives an illuminating account of its stylistic history, of the ways it has varied and evolved, technically and expressively, with the use of shorter and longer lenses, short shots and long takes, in the works of filmmakers from Victor Sj�str� to Steven Spielberg, Sergei Eisenstein to Theo Angelopoulos, Otto Preminger to Hou Hsiao-Hsein. No one since Bazin has treated depth in such depth. And to this central issue of film aesthetics Bordwell brings a larger awareness of film history and a freshly discerning eye informed by that awareness. His discussion of film style under the regime of shallower focus brought on by color and wide screen--an area little explored--seemed to me especially impressive...This stylistic history...yield[s] penetrating critical insights. (Gilberto Perez <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>)<br><br>[<i>On the History of Film Style</i> is] exquisitely logical and virtually inarguable...There is so much that is helpful, useful, illuminating and superbly presented here: the explication of Andr� Bazin's 'dialectical' view of film history and the unity of No�l Burch's 35 year-long 'oppositional program'; the account of how archives, libraries and traveling collections of prints have decisively shaped the 'canon' of film histories; and--most decisively--the rebutting of several highly influential, grand, neo-Hegelian scenarios of the cinema as a medium that slowly 'unfolds' or evolves towards its essence. (Adrian Martin <i>RealTime</i>)<br><br>This superb, insightful synthesis critiques the dozen or so major approaches to the cinema's stylistic development...[This] volume has all the familiar Bordwell virtues: enviably clear prose, copious documentation, superbly chosen film stills that concretely illustrate salient points, and keen, intelligent polemics. A pioneering study highly recommended for upper-division undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. (S.

Clear and accessible, this little book is an intelligible and stimulating guide to those problems of philosophy which often mistakenly make the subject seem too lofty and abstruse for the lay mind. Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell steers the reader through his famous 1910 distinction betwween &#34;knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description, &#34; and introduces important theories of Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Hume, Locke, Plato and others to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.</p><p>Clear and accessible, this little book is an intelligible and stimulating guide to those problems of philosophy which often mistakenly make the subject seem too lofty and abstruse for the lay mind.Bertrand Russell was one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century. His primary interest was in the foundations of mathematics, and his three-volume Principia Mathematica (written with Alfred North Whitehead) is the classic attempt to carry out the programme of deriving the<br>whole of mathematics from a set of simple, self-evident truths. He also wrote widely on other areas of philosophy, and published a large number of writings on social and moral issues.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

A particular favorite: his essay &#34;The Damned Human Race,&#34; wherein he proves, rather convincingly, that an anaconda snake is a higher form of life than an English Earl.&#34;It&#39;s easy to imagine Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain) and Carl Reiner as best of friends, had not the one died 10 years before the other was born. Twain would have enjoyed Reiner&#39;s work in &#34;Your Show of Shows,&#34; &#34;The 2000 Year Old Man,&#34; and &#34;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&#34; just as Reiner clearly appreciates Twain&#39;s humor.&#34; Audiofile</p><h2>Dwarf Car Technology</h2><p>DWARF RACE CAR TECHNOLOGY - This book shows detailed chassis and set-up procedures that will assist you in improving your race car.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>What is cinematic storytelling? How can we understand its technique and complexities? What are its extents and limitations? In this monumental work, David Bordwell catalogues every aspect of film narrative, offering insight into an amazing variety of fiction films. The author, who is as comfortable talking about Al Jolson movies as he is describing the career of Jean-Luc Godard, has made a major contribution to film studies and the field of narrative theory.In this study, David Bordwell offers the first comprehensive account of how movies use fundamental principles of narrative representation, unique features of the film medium, and diverse story-telling patterns to construct their fictional narratives. The result is a pioneering, far-reaching work which will change the way we perceive narrative film--and which every serious film scholar, student or fan will welcome.</p><h2>The Watsons</h2><p>John Coates completes Jane Austen&#39;s uncompleted novel about a young woman who wants the charming wastrel who already has jilted two of her sisters.</p><p>Jane Austen (1775 1817) was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature.?To the Austenites who stop this side of idolatry and who thought they had heard the last of Jane&#39;s sublime gossip, The Watsons comes like a windfall in a blighted summer.?-Christian Century</p><h2>Assessing English Language Learners: Theory and Practice</h2><p><p>Assessing English Language Learners explains and illustrates the main ideas underlying assessment as an activity intimately linked to instruction and the basic principles for developing, using, selecting, and adapting assessment instruments and strategies to assess content knowledge in English language learners (ELLs).

But increasingly, collaboration is no longer viewed as merely a consequence of fieldwork; instead collaboration now preconditions and shapes research design as well as its dissemination. As a result, ethnographic subjects are shifting from being informants to being consultants. The emergence of collaborative ethnography highlights this relationship between consultant and ethnographer, moving it to center stage as a calculated part not only of fieldwork but also of the writing process itself.<br> <br> <i>The Chicago Guide to Collaborative Ethnography</i> presents a historical, theoretical, and practice-oriented road map for this shift from incidental collaboration to a more conscious and explicit collaborative strategy.

On this historical and theoretical base, Lassiter outlines concrete steps for achieving a more deliberate and overt collaborative practice throughout the processes of fieldwork and writing. As a participatory action situated in the ethical commitments between ethnographers and consultants and focused on the co-construction of texts, collaborative ethnography, argues Lassiter, is among the most powerful ways to press ethnographic fieldwork and writing into the service of an applied and public scholarship.<br> <br> A comprehensive and highly accessible handbook for ethnographers of all stripes, <i>The Chicago Guide to Collaborative Ethnography</i> will become a fixture in the development of a critical practice of anthropology, invaluable to both undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty alike.</p></p><p>Collaboration between ethnographers and subjects has long been a product of the close relationships that define ethnographic research.

Crossing the Atlantic in search of the buried cache, Jim and the ship&#39;s crew must brave the elements and a mutinous charge led by the quintessentially ruthless pirate Long John Silver. Brilliantly conceived and splendidly executed, it is a novel that has seized the imagination of generations of adults and children alike.

With its eclectic mixing of stylistic references, punk effectively introduced the postmodern concept of bricolage to the elevated precincts of haute couture and directional ready-to-wear. As a style, punk is about chaos, anarchy, and rebellion. Drawing on&nbsp;provocative sexual and political imagery, punks made fashion overtly hostile and threatening. This aesthetic of violence &#x2013; even of cruelty &#x2013; was intrinsic to the clothes themselves, which were often customized with rips, tears, and slashes, as well as&nbsp;studs, spikes,&nbsp;zippers, D-Rings,&nbsp;safety pins, and razor blades, among other things.</p><p>This extraordinary&nbsp;publication examines the impact of punk&#x2019;s aesthetic of brutality on high fashion, focusing&nbsp;on its do-it-yourself, rip-it-to-shreds ethos, the antithesis of couture&#x2019;s made-to-measure exactitude. Indeed, punk&#x2019;s democracy stands in opposition to fashion&#x2019;s autocracy. Yet, as this book reveals, even haute couture has readily appropriated the visual and symbolic language of punk, replacing beads with studs, paillettes with safety pins, and feathers with razor blades in an attempt to capture the style&#x2019;s rebellious energy. Focusing on high fashion&#x2019;s embrace of punk&#x2019;s aesthetic vocabulary, this book&nbsp;reveals how designers have looked to the quintessential anti-establishment style to originate new ideals of beauty and fashionability.</p></p><p><p>Designers featured in the&nbsp;book include Haider Ackermann, Miguel Adrover, Azzedine Ala�a, Christopher Bailey (Burberry), Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby (Boudicca), Thom Browne, Hussein Chalayan, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Christophe Decarnin (Balmain), Ann Demeulemeester, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana (Dolce &amp; Gabbana), Shelley Fox, John Galliano, Jean Paul Gaultier, Nicolas Ghesqui�re (Balenciaga), Andrew Groves, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren (Viktor (&amp;) Rolf), Marc Jacobs, Christopher Kane, Rei Kawakubo (Comme des Gar�ons), Karl Lagerfeld (Chanel), Helmut Lang, Martin Margiela, Alexander McQueen, Franco Moschino, Thierry Mugler, Kate and Laura Mulleavy (Rodarte), Rick Owens, Gareth Pugh, Zandra Rhodes, Russell Sage, Jeremy Scott, Stephen Sprouse, Anna Sui, Jun Takahashi (Undercover), Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi (Preen), Riccardo Tisci (Givenchy), An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx (A.F.

Clear and easy-to-understand definitions and explanations, with examples that relate to issues and problems relevant to teenagers, will help students gain a better understanding of economics. In 15 chapters, the guide covers all the basic information students need to understand the basic concepts and principles of economics, including: definition of economics in historical context; how various economics systems work; how prices are set in the U.S. economy; consumer behavior; factors of production; types of businesses; competition in the marketplace; the functions of money; banking and credit; types of investments; the federal budget and taxation; federal monetary and fiscal policies; income distribution in the United States; labor and management issues; international trade.</p><p></p><p>Each chapter explores a key question in economics, is illustrated with graphs and tables, and features the latest economic data. Profiles of the major economic thinkers who influenced thinking on concepts and principles provide historical context. In addition to improving students' conceptual understanding, the guide also encourages critical thinking by investigating controversial issues related to topics as varied as the minimum wage, the decay of our natural environment, poverty, and business ethics of multinational corporations. An extensive glossary of key economic concepts, terms, and institutions is a handy tool. Unlike cut-and-dried, difficult to follow reference works on economics, this guide, designed and written especially for students, will help readers better understand economic information and issues.</p></p><p><p>DAVID E.

We cannot quote Shakespeare to describe a headache. We must, Woolf says, invent language to describe pain. And though illness enhances our perceptions, she observes that it reduces self-consciousness; it is "the great confessional." Woolf discusses the cultural taboos associated with illness and explores how illness changes the way we read. Poems clarify and astonish, Shakespeare exudes new brilliance, and so does melodramatic fiction!</p><p><i>On Being Ill </i>was published as an individual volume by Hogarth Press in 1930. While other Woolf essays, such as <i>A Room of One&#x2019;s Own </i>and <i>Three Guineas, </i>were first published by Hogarth as individual volumes and have since been widely available<i>, On Being Ill</i> has been overlooked. The Paris Press edition features original cover art by Woolf&#x2019;s sister, the painter Vanessa Bell.

She is one of the co-editors of the <i>Oxford Poets Anthologies.</i>The essay has the virtue of suggesting an origin for [Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s] impassioned, circumnavigatory style: her racing, feverish mind.&#x201d; <b>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW</b><br><br> I&#x2019;d assign my students to read, ten times daily, the first sentence of Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s brilliant and beautiful essay <i>On Being Ill</i> until they learned to appreciate the full potential, the dazzling glory, and the clarity of the complex sentence .

Woolf lets her consciousness roam over the unpredictable terrain of sickness the sick body, the sick mind and how difficult it is for us to find words to describe this altered state. This is a brilliant and odd book, charged with restrained emotion and sudden humor.&#x201d; <b>LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK REVIEW</b><br><br> Examining her own familiarity with illness, Woolf undertakes a rigorous, compassionate, and droll investigation of how illness shapes the identity of a sick patient, particularly the invalid, not only affecting his or her perceptions of the world but also awakening the helplessness of being unable to convey those perceptions, or the effects of illness, to other. [ ] Because of its enduring relevance, On Being Ill is a necessary and compelling read. The slender and striking hardbound edition from Paris Press gives an old text new life.&#x201d; <b>YALE JOURNAL FOR HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE</b><br><br> On Being Ill&#x2019; is one of those peculiarly fascinating essays that Woolf wrote which defy categorization: part mediation, part autobiography and part critical analysis; it refuses to be pigeon-holed.

The Preface to Hegel's first major work, the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, lays the groundwork for all his other writing by explaining what is most innovative about Hegel's philosophy.</p><p>This new translation combines readability with maximum precision, breaking Hegel's long sentences and simplifying their often complex structure. At the same time, it is more faithful to the original than any previous translation.</p><p>The heart of the book is the detailed commentary, supported by an introductory essay. Together they offer a lucid and elegant explanation of the text and elucidate difficult issues in Hegel, making his claims and intentions intelligible to the beginner while offering interesting and original insights to the scholar and advanced student. The commentary often goes beyond the particular phrase in the text to provide systematic context and explain related topics in Hegel and his predecessors (including Kant, Spinoza, and Aristotle, as well as Fichte, Schelling, H�lderlin, and others).</p><p>The commentator refrains from playing down (as many interpreters do today) those aspects of Hegel's thought that are less acceptable in our time, and abstains from mixing his own philosophical preferences with his reading of Hegel's text. His approach is faithful to the historical Hegel while reconstructing Hegel's ideas within their own context.</p></p><p><p>"Yovel's translation is impressively accurate, uses the plainest English possible, and cleverly breaks up Hegel's long sentences into shorter, more readable ones without distorting the original meaning. But the real contribution to the literature is Yovel's commentary and introduction.

This work, known primarily for its erotic realism, is also a landmark in the development of narrative art--not only from a specifically Chinese perspective but in a world-historical context.</p><br><p> With the possible exception of <i>The Tale of Genji</i> (1010) and <i>Don Quixote</i> (1615), there is no earlier work of prose fiction of equal sophistication in world literature. Although its importance in the history of Chinese narrative has long been recognized, the technical virtuosity of the author, which is more reminiscent of the Dickens of <i>Bleak House</i>, the Joyce of <i>Ulysses</i>, or the Nabokov of <i>Lolita</i> than anything in the earlier Chinese fiction tradition, has not yet received adequate recognition. This is partly because all of the existing European translations are either abridged or based on an inferior recension of the text. This translation and its annotation aim to faithfully represent and elucidate all the rhetorical features of the original in its most authentic form and thereby enable the Western reader to appreciate this Chinese masterpiece at its true worth.</p></p><p><b>David Tod Roy</b> (1933&#x2013;2016) was professor emeritus of Chinese literature at the University of Chicago.

The novel is a sprawling panorama of life and times in urban China, allegedly set safely in the Sung dynasty, but transparently contemporary to the author's late sixteenth-century world, as scores of internal references demonstrate. The eight hundred or so men, women, and children who appear in the book cover a breath-taking variety of human types, and encompass pretty much every imaginable mood and genre--from sadism to tenderness, from light humor to philosophical musings, from acute social commentary to outrageous satire.""<b>---Jonathan Spence, <i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>"[A] book of manners for the debauched.

Each chapter discusses a life cycle, has Words to Know, and a sidebar called Did You Know? The chapters simply discuss ideas with vocabulary words set out in bold print. The chapters have fun recipes for snacks and suggestions for projects. The b&amp;w illustrations are simple but support and enhance the text. This book was enjoyable to read, and I wanted to go find some children and try some of the experiments with them. Science teachers and anyone interested in science will find it a fun book to work with. Recommended"<br><br><i>Science Books and Films</i><br>"As its title suggests, this book explores life cycles in organisms ranging from fungi to humans. Its six chapters treat multiple topics, including the continuity of life across generations, scientific classification, birth in invertebrates, germination in plants, growth, metamorphosis, decay, and environmental disruption. Children ages 6-10, especially those with a science bent, will respond to this title's kid-friendly layout. The book has the look and feel of a coloring book; it is meant to be marked up and personalized. Its many quirky factoids will appeal to young science buffs, and the rapidly paced shift from background information to hands-on activities combats the boredom factor. This book is good for parents when kids complain, 'I don't have anything to do.'"<br><br><i>Children's Literature</i><br>"There's no distance between Ms Reilly's text and the kids she is addressing. She pulls them in with questions at the beginning of each chapter, questions that they can relate to: "Can you remember when you were younger? You were smaller, sure. And you probably couldn't do many things that you can do now. Maybe you couldn't ride a two-wheeler yet, or write a thank-you note card, or climb the monkey bars at the playground." She holds their attention by comparing the familiar to less familiar lives of plants and animals that the readers may not know about yet. Finally, she offers engaging activities that solidify the ideas presented. In addition to an overview of life cycles, her topics include: the systems of classification; how babies (including seedlings) enter the world; how all of these organisms grow to maturity; and threats to life cycles. Early science books don't get too much better than this. This book will be welcomed by teachers as students study life cycles in their classroom as well as by parents who may have fun with the activities, including Insect Life Cycle Snack Mix, a Mealworm Nursery, and tree measuring, done from the ground.

Written in December 1862 by Private Wright Vinson in Tennessee to his wife, Christiana, in Georgia, these lines go to the heart of why Scott Walker wrote this history of the Fifty-seventh Georgia Infantry, a unit of the famed Mercer&#x2019;s Brigade.<p>All but a few members of the Fifty-seventh lived within a close radius of eighty miles from each other. More than just an account of their military engagements, this is a collective biography of a close-knit group. Relatives and neighbors served and died side by side in the Fifty-seventh, and Walker excels at showing how family ties, friendships, and other intimate dynamics played out in wartime settings. Humane but not sentimental, the history abounds in episodes of real feeling: a starving soldier&#x2019;s theft of a pie; another&#x2019;s open confession, in a letter to his wife, that he may desert; a slave&#x2019;s travails as a camp orderly.</p><p>Drawing on memoirs and a trove of unpublished letters and diaries, Walker follows the soldiers of the Fifty-seventh as they push far into Unionist Kentucky, starve at the siege of Vicksburg, guard Union prisoners at the Andersonville stockade, defend Atlanta from Sherman, and more. Hardened fighters who would wish hell on an incompetent superior but break down at the sight of a dying Yankee, these are real people, as rarely seen in other Civil War histories.</p></p><p>Scott Walker is the pastor of First Baptist Church of Waco, Texas, the author of nine books, and an adjunct professor at Baylor University. His great-great-grandfather was a member of the Fifty-seventh Georgia Infantry."The letters, diaries, and other information Scott Walker located and utilized on the soldiers and families of the 57th Georgia infantry are among the finest I've ever encountered. He has done complete justice to these superb primary sources by writing a narrative that is richly descriptive yet focused and restrained. Walker allows the soldiers and their families to speak for themselves while placing their words and deeds in a clear and meaningful context."--T. Michael Parrish, author of <i>Richard Taylor</i> and editor of <i>Brothers In Gray</i><br><br> Civil War regimental histories are thick on the ground now, but <i>Hell's Broke Loose in Georgia</i> is a different sort of creature, a penetrating look at the inner world and lives of men who marched, ate, slept, fought, and died together. Not so much a unit history as a 'family' portrait of men bound by the war, Scott Walker's book offers a glimpse of the personality and inner world of almost all Civil War units, North and South alike. This is the part of regimental history that too many regimental historians overlook."--William C. Davis, author of <i>Look Away!</i> and <i>Jefferson Davis</i><br><br>"Amidst the fog enveloping the vast array of lit�erature on the American Civil War, much of it mun�dane and redundant, emerges a real jewel of a book. For in <i>Hell's Broke Loose in Georgia, </i>author Scott Walker breaks free from the usual litany of battles, campaigns, and troop movements and serves up an engaging, tightly woven, account of what the participants <i>felt </i>during the campaigns, rather than how they fought." &#x2014;<i>Georgia Historical Quarterly</i><br><br>"A beautifully written narrative . . . <i>Hell's Broke Loose in Georgia</i> stands as a heartfelt recounting of one regiment's triumphs and traumas."--<i>Journal of American History</i><br><br>"Walker uses this disastrous defeat to criticize the Confederate high command, something he does with stylish effectiveness throughout the book as Southern forces in the West stagger from one debacle to another . . . But <i>Hell&#x2019;s Broke Loose in Georgia</i> isn't unique because it points out the shortcomings of Hood, Braxton Bragg and Jefferson Davis. It's Walker's passion for his subject, combined with the remarkable correspondence from Confederates to their families, that gives this unit portrait such bold color."--<i>Savannah Morning News</i><br><br>"Diligent use of manuscript letters makes this [book] a sturdy soldiers&#x2019; chronicle ably set in Western Theater history."--<i>Blue and Gray</i><br><br>"Walker&#x2019;s book is both a labor of love and an excellent insight into the true nature of military life during the Civil War."--<i>North &amp; South</i><br><br> This book is not about glorious victory or honorable defeat; it is about the struggle of men to hold on to their humanity in war&#x2019;s fiery furnace of inhumanity. This is a book about hell&#x2014;hell with a few humorous anecdotes, hell with unexpected acts of kindness, but hell.&#x201d;--<i>Southern Distinction</i></p><h2>Textures: Pour approfondir la communication orale et �crite</h2><p>Language proficiency emerges not solely as mastery of discrete skills, but also through one&#x2019;s ability to express ideas fully in a variety of cultural contexts.

Less fortunate than these few were West Coasters such as Sonny Criss, Harold Land, Curtis Counce, Carl Perkins, Lennie Niehaus, Roy Porter, Teddy Edwards, Gerald Wilson, and those others whose careers languished without achieving either a later revival or even an early brief taste of fame. Certainly some West Coast jazz players have been awarded a central place in jazz history, but invariably they have been those who, like Charles Mingus or Eric Dolphy, left California for Manhattan. Those who stayed behind were, for the most part, left behind.&nbsp;The time has come for a critical re-evaluation of this body of work. With more than forty years of perspective--since modern jazz came to California-we can perhaps now begin to make sense of the rich array of music presented there during those glory years. But to do so, we need to start almost from scratch. We need to throw away the stereotypes of West Coast jazz, reject the simplifications, catchphrases, and pigeonholings that have only confused the issue. So many discussions of the music have begun by asking, "What was West Coast jazz?"--as if some simple definition would answer all our questions. And when no simple answer emerged--how could it when the same critics asking the question could hardly agree on a definition of jazz itself?--this failure was brandished as grounds for dismissing the whole subject.&nbsp;My approach is different. I start with the music itself, the musicians themselves, the geography and social situation, the clubs and the culture. I tried to learn what they have to tell us, rather than regurgitate the dubious critical consensus of the last generation. Was West Coast jazz the last regional style or merely a marketing fad? Was there really ever any such thing as West Coast jazz? If so, was it better or worse than East Coast jazz? Such questions are not without merit, but they provide a poor start for a serious historical inquiry.&nbsp;I ask readers hoping for quick and easy answers to approach this work with an open mind and a modicum of patience. Generalizations will emerge; broader considerations will become increasingly clear; but only as we approach the close of this complex story, after we have let the music emerge in all its richness and diversity. By starting with some theory of West Coast jazz, we run the risk of seeing only what fits into our theory. Too many accounts of the music have fallen into just this trap. Instead, we need to see things with fresh eyes, hear the music again with fresh ears.</p><p>"A book that desperately needed to be written and has turned out to be a surprise landmark and masterpiece."&nbsp;--Bruce and Joel Klauber, <i>Jazziz</i>&nbsp;"Gioia writes with the musical knowledge of a jazzman and the immediacy of a reporter, in language that has a casual grace."&nbsp;--Bill Kisliuk, San Francisco Review of Books&nbsp;"Ted Gioia is very much a West Coast jazz partisan, and his informed enthusiasm and wide-ranging research make West Coast Jazz a highly rewarding and arguable book. . . . Makes a large, disparate, unruly subject not only coherent but also intriguing."&nbsp;--<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;"While the requisite space is devoted to such cool icons as Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker, Gioia also takes an expert, often iconoclastic look at the careers of other West Coast jazz men, both well-known and obscure. . . . Anyone looking for a basic history of the California scene should start with this smart, opinionated book."&nbsp;--Chris Morris, <i>Billboard</i><b>Ted Gioia</b>, one of the founders of Stanford University's Jazz Studies program, is also the author of <i>The History of Jazz</i> (1997) and <i>The Imperfect Art: Reflections on Jazz and Modern Culture</i> (1988; winner of the ASCAP Deems-Taylor award).

It&#x2019;s befouling our air, land, waters, food, and bodies. The US tosses out enough foodstuff to feed the rest of the world. America is the largest buyer of fashion and cosmetics, the second dirtiest industry in the world. We lead the planet in transportation usage and waste, and we&#x2019;re now polluting outer space. Throwaway Nation takes a look at the pileup of waste in the US, including the problem of plastic, the industry of overmedication, e-waste products, everyday garbage, fast fashion trash, space waste, and other forms of profligacy that serve to make our nation the biggest waster on the planet. Looking at the environmental impact of so much garbage, Dondero explores not just how we got here and where we&#x2019;re headed, but ways in which we might be able to curb the tide. <br>From what you do and don&#x2019;t eat, what and how your products are packaged, the rampant production of clothes, the space and waste in which you work, live, what you breath, eat, drink, the tools you use to work and play, the energy overproduced and ill-used for a pleasant lifestyle, the waste you generate, and how humans are beginning to clutter the cosmos&#x2014;all and more are profiled in the Throwaway Nation&#x2014;and what we ought to do to prohibit and mitigate the flow of our garbage and to use it productively.</p><p>Jeff Dondero has a diverse background and experience in writing, ranging from web content, B2B, books, hard news, and interviews to feature writing. He began his career as stringer and freelancer for the San Francisco Examiner, worked as a reporter and editor for several suburban newspapers, was the entertainment editor for The Marin Independent Journal, a writer and editor of various magazines, wrote for KTVU-TV in the San Francisco Bay Area, toiled in a trade magazine mill, and created a website dedicated to sustainable construction industries (http://www.greenbuildingdigest.net/). He was invited as a writer-in-residence at the art colony in Rancho Vista, Arizona in 2014, where he wrote a slim volume of poetry. He continues to expand his national readership with books, social media, various writers&#x2019; blogs and websites, radio and television appearances. Jeff Dondero is also the author of The Energy Wise Home: Practical Ideas for Saving Energy, Money, and the Planet (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2017) and The Energy Wise Workplace: Practical and Cost-Effective Ideas for a Sustainable and Green Workplace (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2017).Starred Review: Humans are the only known species to create non-biodegradable waste, according to science writer Dondero. While our microscopic predecessors left us with an oxygen-rich atmosphere and enriched soils, we pollute. While populations of other animal species reach a balance in nature, we proliferate exponentially. As a species, we produce many tons of waste every second, fouling our air, water, and land and threatening our future. In Throwaway Nation, Dondero enumerates our many wasteful ways, explains their consequences, and offers remedies. He asks every reader to help, suggesting actions that we can take as individuals and identifying difficult societal shifts needed to mitigate climate change, pollution, and depletion of natural resources. As the author&#x2019;s interests are wide-ranging&#x2014;including debris in space, hours wasted in offices, and needless government spending&#x2014;there should be a topic of concern for every reader. (<i>Booklist, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>Throwaway Nation is an extensively researched and entertainingly written examination of the detritus of our industrialized and consumer culture: from landfills to toxic waste and from fouled air to the North Pacific gyre. In lively and informed prose, Jeff Dondero takes us on a cradle-to-grave journey that materials take as they pass from the natural world, into our everyday lives, possibly through the recycling process, to the trash bin, and to a final resting place. Packed with facts, tidbits, and insight, Throwaway Nation also provides solutions, small and large.

Each retains the integrity and tone of the original book.</p> <p>Interest Level: 5-12<br>Reading Level: 3-4</p></p><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original.

For use in the classroom and the research library, it provides the vital mathematical background and algorithmic skills required in the production of numerical software. Gene Golub and Charles Van Loan combine the uncluttered presentation and problem-solving opportunities of a fine textbook with the detailed bibliographies and strong algorithmic content required by professional readers. While discussing such general principles as the exploitation of structure , reliance on orthogonal transformations, and the assessment of problem sensitivity, the authors touch on numerous specifics, including Toeplitz systems, Vandermonde systems, constrained least squares, generalized eigenvalue problems, and matrix function problems. No other book covers the field of linear algebra as completely as Matrix Computations.

The latest in computer-generated images allow us to look at plants growing, self-replicating, responding to external factors and even mutating, without becoming entangled in the underlying mathematical formulae involved. The authors place particular emphasis on Lindenmayer systems - a notion conceived by one of the authors, Aristid Lindenmayer, and internationally recognised for its exceptional elegance in modelling biological phenomena. Nonetheless, the two authors take great care to present a survey of alternative methods for plant modelling.</p><p>This book is the first comprehensive volume on the computer simulation of plant development.

The main focus is on the law governed by bilateral and multilateral investment treaties. It traces the purpose, context, and evolution of the clauses and provisions characteristic of contemporary investment treaties, and analyses the case law, interpreting the issues raised by standard clauses. Particular consideration is given to broad treaty-rules whose understanding in practice has mainly been shaped by their interpretation and application by international tribunals. In addition, the book introduces the dispute settlement mechanisms for enforcing investment law, outlining the operation of Investor vs State arbitration.<br><br>Combining a systematic analytical study of the texts and principles underlying investment law with a jurisprudential analysis of the case law arising in international tribunals, this book offers an ideal introduction to the principles of international investment law and arbitration, for students or practitioners alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>Rudolf Dolzer</strong> is the Former Director of the Institute of International Law at the University of Bonn.<br>He has presented a new concept for a Framework Agreement on the Promotion of German-Russia Energy Relations in April 2011 in Omsk at the Annual Meeting of the German-Russian Raw Materials Forum.

To most of us, UPS is a reliable fact of life. But to well-informed businesspeople, Big Brown is a company to emulate. Quietly and steadfastly, UPS has earned a reputation as one of the leading companies in America, known as much for its innovative practices as its skill in creating satisfied customers <i>and</i> employees. </p><p>Just in time for the company's hundredth anniversary, UPS has allowed authors Mike Brewster and Fred Dalzell unprecedented access to their facilities, their workers, and their history -- including their mistakes. What emerges are clear-cut lessons from which any business can benefit. <i>Driving Change</i> is an enlightening, absorbing, and dynamic account of a company at the very fulcrum of global commerce.</p></p><p><b>Mike Brewster</b> is a business journalist and the author of the books <i>Unaccountable</i> and <i>King Capital</i>. He lives in New York City. <b>Frederick Dalzell</b> is a historian and consultant whose recent books include <i>Rising Tide: Lessons from 165 Years of Brand Building at Procter &amp; Gamble</i>. He is a partner in The Winthrop Group, a firm specializing in historical research and archival services, and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Near the outset of this meticulous survey of UPS's history, business journalist Brewster sums up the message he wants businesspeople to take away: that UPS may be seen as at once humdrum and wonderful to behold. But he goes heavy on the humdrum in a book whose clear-cut lessons are too rudimentary for the corporate audience he's courting. It's only when the author focuses on little-known trivia and insider information&#x2014;gleaned from what the jacket copy touts as his unprecedented access to the delivery giant&#x2014;that his account approaches the wonderful. In recounting the evolution of the American behemoth from the Gold Rush days when 15-year-old Jim Casey transported everything from bail money to morphine, Brewster turns up some shiny nuggets: the trucks are brown so dirt won't show; in Zambia, UPS uses canoes to make deliveries; in New York City, the company would prefer to offer the city government an annual payment instead of tracking thousands of parking tickets. Like UPS lifer Greg Niemann, whose <i>Big Brown: The Untold Story of UPS</i> (Jossey-Bass, Feb.), Brewster heaps praise on UPS, leaving skeptical readers to wonder what remains untold. But Brewster's emphasis on UPS business strategies won't be of much help to the management audience. It's better suited to UPS's beloved everyman Joe. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Baking instructor Sarah Black starts with the simplest &#x201c;plain white&#x201d; dough, then makes small changes to ingredients, proportions, and shapes to take the reader through ten &#x201c;foundation&#x201d; breads, from baguettes to ciabatta to whole-wheat <i>pain de campagne </i>to sourdough. Notes and teaching moments, shaping instructions, clear step-by-step photography, and additional recipes build on this foundation to create new and varied breads that will appeal to bakers of all skill levels, including: sandwich loaves, rustic country-style breads, dinner rolls, pizza and focaccia, crackers, and hearty breads studded with dried fruits, nuts, seeds, or whole grains.</p><p>Sarah Black is a baker and baking instructor with 25 years of professional baking experience in New York City, having worked at such legendary bakeries as Tom Cat Bakery and Amy&#39;s Bread and with such companies as Whole Foods Market and Pepperidge Farm. Her future plans include teaching bread classes at The Seasoned Farmhouse and opening a recreational bread and baking school, floral studio and cafe with Tricia Wheeler and Sarah Lagrotteria, called Flowers and Bread, in the fall of 2015, in Clintonville, Ohio.

If you're looking for a book that will ease you into bread making (or a break from the super bro-y bread books of recent years) this is it."<br>--<strong>Epicurious.com</strong><br><br>"It's hard to imagine how the printed page can capture the sensations--touch, taste, feel, and smell--involved in baking bread.

Concepts such as the Lamb of God, the Four Horsemen, the Seventh Seal, the Beasts and Antichrist, the Whore of Babylon, Armageddon, the Millennium, the Last Judgement, the New Jerusalem, and the ubiquitous angels of the Apocalypse have captured the popular imagination. One can hardly open a newspaper or click on a news site without reading about impending financial or climate-change Armageddon, while the concept of the Four Horsemen pervades popular music, gaming, and satire. Yet few people know much about either the basic meaning or original context of these concepts or the multiplicity of different ways in which they have been interpreted by visual artists in particular. The visual history of this most widely illustrated of all the biblical books deserves greater attention.<br><br>This book fills these gaps in a striking and original way by means of ten concise thematic chapters which explain the origins of these concepts from the book of Revelation in an accessible way. These explanations are augmented and developed via a carefully selected sample of the ways in which the concepts have been treated by artists through the centuries. The 120 visual examples are drawn from a wide range of time periods and media including the ninth-century Trier Apocalypse, thirteenth-century Anglo-Norman Apocalypse Manuscripts such as the Lambeth and Trinity Apocalypses, the fourteenth-century Angers Apocalypse Tapestry, fifteenth-century Apocalypse altarpieces by Van Eyck and Memling, D�rer and Cranach's sixteenth-century Apocalypse woodcuts, and more recently a range of works by William Blake, J.M.W. Turner, Max Beckmann, as well as film posters and film stills, cartoons, and children's book illustrations. The final chapter demonstrates the continuing resonance of all the themes in contemporary religious, political, and popular thinking, while throughout the book a contrast will be drawn between those readers of Revelation who have seen it in terms of earthly revolutions in the here and now, and those who have adopted a more spiritual, other-worldly approach.<br></p><p><br><strong>Natasha O'Hear</strong> specialises in artistic interpretations of the Book of Revelation.

The authors chart a clear path through a thicket of theological and �sthetic considerations without losing their way." -- <em>Eric Hoffman, The Fortean Times</em><p></p><br>"<em>Picturing the Apocalypse</em> is a strong work of reception history, and its appeal to contemporary scholarly analysis usually take a back seat to artistic representations and interpretations. This is especially important and useful in a book about Revelation, which resists easy scholarly analysis and categorization as vehemently as it resists simple visual representation. The thrill of the book is encountering the ways myriad artists, from medieval book illuminators to Reformation woodcut makers to 20th and 21st-century filmmakers, have contended with the overwhelming weirdness of John's Apocalypse. O'Hear and O'Hear spin this difficulty into a compelling narrative that surveys a landscape while also coming to rest on many of the beautiful, grotesque, terrifying, divine, and human vignettes found in the corpus of artistic receptions of Revelation."--Eric C.

It offers a very necessary reminder that the visual character of this remarkable text can often be best communicated through art, music, and poetry, which they illustrate so well. Not only does it introduce us to the ways in which this apocalyptic text has stimulated some of the most dramatic and inspired paintings down the centuries, but it also helps us get some sense of why this book has grasped the imagination of readers past and present.

They are kind. They are measured. And this is what makes Picturing the Apocalypse such an engrossing, delightful and ultimately uplifting read . . .

Taken together, this is pure nectar to those who aim for consistently superior stock market performance." -Barron's<br> <br> "The Education of a Speculator offers plenty of insights into the way markets work, but the epiphanies are what a reader might expect from Lao-tzu rather than, say, Graham and Dodd." -Worth magazine<br> <br> "The Education of a Speculator is the first meaningful book on speculating. Successful speculating is as fine an art as chess, checkers, fishing, poker, tennis, painting, and music.

But it's the logic behind the eccentricities that is the real story. The Education of a Speculator is a sojourn inside the one-of-a-kind mind of Victor Niederhoffer, a trader in commodities and a keen observer of life. He has trained himself to look at the world in a singular fashion: where the guy on the street sees opportunity, Niederhoffer has scoped out all the downsides and done the contrarian thinking necessary to turn a profit. Niederhoffer draws material from disciplines as varied as biology, music, cards, and sports. His book, written with humor and verve, offers readers a chance to see the world through his lenses. The result is a genuinely new perspective on life (unless you too happened to grow up a speculator). This is a terrific, rewarding book.</p>A fascinating story that successfully entwines the complete life and education of a top commodity trader with his successes and failures in the markets.

In her meticulously researched and groundbreaking work, Diane McGuinness faults outmoded reading systems for this crisis -- and provides the answers we need to give our children the reading skills they need. Drawing on twenty-five years of cutting-edge research, Dr. McGuinness presents bold new &#34;phoneme awareness&#34; programs that overcome the tremendous shortcomings of other systems by focusing on the crucial need to understand and hear reliably the sounds of a language before learning to read. Maintaining that any child can be taught to read fluently if given proper instruction, she dramatically reveals how dyslexia and behavior problems such as ADD stem not from neurological disorders but from flawed methods of reading instruction. With invaluable information on remedial reading programs that can correct various ineffective reading strategies, this book is a must for concerned parents, teachers, and others who want to make a difference.</p><p><p>Chances are, if you can read this book, you're lucky. Even so, you may be reading it less well than you could. The fact is, you probably learned to read the wrong way, but somehow you've managed to get by, even do well. Many children and adults are not so lucky. </p><p>In America today, 43 percent of our children test below grade level in reading. Among adults, 42 million are functionally illiterate. The numbers are staggering, but in our schools, the problem is only getting worse. Most schools teach reading with phonics, the whole language method, or some eclectic combination of the two. Unfortunately, these methods are failing our children; phonics by 30 percent, whole language by 50 percent. </p><p>We are in crisis. Now, what are we going to do about it? If we're wise, we'll read and use what's in this book at home -- and in every school in America -- because it is the first thorough diagnosis of the problem and the first viable solution. The old methods don't work, and this book will tell you why. Psychologist Diane McGuinness draws on twenty-five years of solid reading research that shows exactly how the current system fails and how to fix it. </p><p>She explains that the ability to read depends on the ability to hear the sounds of our language correctly, and on a working knowledge of something called the spelling code, which is the key to how English spelling works: what letters and letter combinations go with which sounds. This connection of sounds and the symbols that represent them is crucial to learning how to read, and McGuinness explains it with rigor, clarity, and expertise. Moreover, she shows how this method is scientifically proven and has transformed so-called dyslexics and troubled readers into expert readers and spellers, often in astoundingly short periods of time. </p><p>Diane McGuinness has given us the blueprint for a reading revolution -- one that offers real hope to the millions of children and adults who are failing needlessly in school and in life.</p><b>Diane McGuinness, Ph.D.,</b> is a cognitive-development psychologist and Professor at the University of South Florida.

To that aim, the book takes into account the major contrastive features of the sounds of French and English and addresses the particular challenges that American native speakers face when learning to pronounce French. The book treats all the sounds of the language in detail. With the help of chart summaries, it expands on the discussion of sounds that present the most difficulty for students, such as nasal vowels, mid vowels, semi-vowels, mute e, liaison. Finally, the book discusses the correlation between sound and spelling in the case of certain consonants. </p> <p> The book is divided into fourteen chapters, and the materials can be taught in their entirety in 42 (50-minute) class days. Since some series of sounds are more challenging to students, the chapters are of unequal length.

Our writing, our speaking, and our teaching must be relevant to the problems facing people today, and they must in some way help solve those problems.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Sources in Chinese History: Diverse Perspectives from 1644 to the Present</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The format of <i>Sources in Chinese History </i>assumes the use of outside readings or a textbook, but for the more adventurous it could also be used as a standalone sourcebook.&nbsp; Each chapter begins with a short introductory essay that examines a key event, personage, or theme from the period covered by the chapter.&nbsp; In addition, the authors&nbsp;have selected perspectives that help to orient the student to the issues, trends and challenges of each particular period, and&nbsp;hope that the different viewpoints presented will lead students to rethink the way in which historical events are commonly understood.</p></p><p><p>Glance at any recent newspaper, magazine or mainstream website and one will encounter some mention of China. The number of Americans and Europeans studying the Chinese language has soared in recent years.&nbsp; Foreign investment in China and Chinese exports to the world are increasing at a record pace.&nbsp; Western political leaders ponder how to join or combat the country&#x2019;s expanding influence. Yet, this emerging &#x201c;discovery&#x201d; of China should more correctly be described as a &#x201c;re-discovery.&#x201d; European and American churches have sent missionaries to China for more than five centuries.&nbsp; Western traders and businesses have sought Chinese products, and pursued new markets for their own goods, for a commensurate period. Still, this newfound interest in China suggests there is a need for a sourcebook that goes beyond the narrow boundaries of political and intellectual thought; a sourcebook that explores the broad cultural, social and ethnic trends that are the foundation of a 21st century China. </p><p>"This book, in a word, is excellent. The image and commentary feature is appealing; it is an extraordinarily effective device for "hooking" students and making the past much "closer."

The text analyzes the changing patterns of world population growth, including the effects of migration, war, disease, technology and culture. Its core purpose in explaining the links between nature, culture and demography is to encourage humanity's search for ways to prevent future demographic catastrophes brought about by environmental or human agency. Valued for its informative and accessible style as well as its fresh treatment of contemporary theory, it covers issues that are crucial to the future of every species, human and animal.</p> This sixth edition, which is now revised to reflect current trends and their implications for future demographic developments, keeps the essence of the book intact, remaining compact and concise. Livi-Bacci has modified the statistical and bibliographical information with the inclusion of the 2015 UN population projections revision and developments in China's population policy. The text has also been updated to strengthen the major subject areas of Africa, international migration and population and the environment, which is quickly gaining importance in terms of its increasing dramatic global impact.<b>Massimo Livi-Bacci</b> is Professor of Demography at the University of Florence. A former president of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, his extensive research interests include contemporary demography as well as the history of population.

Who Are We? Where Are We Going?</h2><p>Traditionally, science has regarded the universe as made up of inert matter and empty space. Duane Elgin brings together extraordinary evidence from cosmology, biology, and physics to show that the universe is not dead but rather uniquely alive, an insight that, he shows, is in harmony with all of the world&#x2019;s major spiritual traditions. He explores how this view radically transforms our concept of ourselves, our place in the cosmos, and the evolutionary trajectory of the human family. The nonliving view of the universe has led to rampant materialism and global environmental degradation. To transform our planetary crises we need to move past a paradigm of separation and exploitation and learn to live sustainably on the Earth, in harmony with one another, and in communion with the living universe.</p><p>DUANE ELGIN is an internation- ally recognized visionary, speaker, and author. He earned his MBA from the Wharton Business School and then an MA in economic history from the University of Pennsylvania. In 2001 he was awarded an honorary PhD for work in &#x201c;ecological and spiritual transformation&#x201d; from the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. In 2006 Elgin received the<br> Goi International Peace Award in recognition of his contribution to a global &#x201c;vision, consciousness, and lifestyle&#x201d; that fosters a &#x201c;more sustainable and spiritual culture.&#x201d;The Great Awakening<br><br> The universe is a communion and a community.<br> We ourselves are that communion become conscious of itself.<br><br> &#x2014;THOMAS BERRY1<br><br> Is the universe non-living at its foundations? If it is dead and without consciousness in its underpinnings, then it is unaware of&#x2014;and indifferent to&#x2014;our existence. What do you think? Are we strangers in a strange land, unwelcome outsiders?<br><br> What if, instead, the universe is alive at its deepest foundations? If there is a permeating field of aliveness and an ecology of consciousness throughout the universe, what does that mean for our life and life purpose?<br><br> You may wonder, with the challenges of climate disruption, energy shortages, wars over resources, deep poverty, and more, why should you care about the universe and our connection with it? My answer is that we humans need to step back and get our bearings.<br><br> The dream of material prosperity is becoming a collective nightmare as we overwhelm the Earth with our sheer numbers and our voracious appetites as consumers. With growing urgency we are being pushed to imagine new ways we can live together agreeably and sustainably on this planet. Yet we find ourselves without a compelling sense of direction. It feels as if we are wandering into history&#x2014;alienated from the Earth, from one another, and from the universe. We are lost. Where do we find a way forward that articulates a common journey for the human family?<br><br> I believe we must look beyond devising solutions to the energy crisis or the climate crisis, although that is important. Possibly the most fundamental challenge facing humanity is to look beyond adversity and visualize futures of great opportunity. In a self-fulfilling prophecy, we actualize who we think we are. The archetypes and stories we present to ourselves act as beacons guiding us into the future. To explore potential guiding images, let us step back, draw upon the deepest wisdom that humanity has to offer, and ask three fundamental questions:<br><br> 1. Where are we? Although there is a natural inclination to start with ourselves, it is important to begin with the question of where we are rather than who we are. When we start with ourselves, we tend to asssume that our physical body defines who we are, and from this a cascade of consequences flow&#x2014;giving us the kind of world we have now. If we begin, not with ourselves, but with where we are, and if we freshly open to the universe and ask what kind of place this is, then we may be led to a larger understanding; we may see that we are more than biological beings&#x2014;that we have a cosmic connection as well.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s look at the universe in which we live and ask this core question: Do we live in a living or non-living universe? Einstein said if he could ask God one question, it would be &#x201c;Is the universe friendly or not?&#x201d; This book asks an even deeper question: Is the universe alive or not? The way we answer this simple question has profound implications for whether we experience life with feelings of alienation or belonging, see it as pointless or purposeful, and regard it with feelings of indifference or reverence.<br><br> 2. Who are we? Having looked at the universe in which we live, we can now ask: Are we beings limited to our physical biology or do we somehow participate intimately with the larger universe? Our collective self-image as a species has yet to form, but it will emerge vividly within the next few decades as the communications revolution intersects with the perfect storm of an unyielding, whole-systems crisis for the Earth. This unfolding crisis will force us to take a hard look at ourselves in the mirror of our collective media and ask &#x201c;Who are we as a species?&#x201d; Are we no more than bio-physical beings in a struggle for material survival&#x2014;or do we have a cosmic connection and purpose that calls us to awaken to a vastly larger potential?<br><br> 3. Where are we going? Is there a discernible direction to life and evolution? Without a dramatic change in direction, humanity is headed toward catastrophe. The changes required for humanity to live sustainably on the Earth are so broad, so deep, and so far-reaching that if we are to avoid a global calamity it is crucial that we discover &#x201c;great stories&#x201d; that can align and orient our journey into the future. Is there a story of our awakening as a species with such compelling promise that it overcomes our fears and our historical inertia?<br> A Personal Perspective<br><br> To bring a more personal perspective to these questions, I want to share a few experiences that have been important threads in the tapestry of my life. Connecting with the miracle of aliveness has been a passionate interest since growing up on an Idaho farm in the 1940s and 1950s. I was born prematurely to my mother, a nurse, and my father, a farmer. We lived in the country with my brother, two dogs, a half-dozen cats and assorted farm animals a couple of miles outside of a small town of about five hundred people. Growing up in the big sky country of Idaho, I felt myself a small creature against a vast landscape. Because I worked on the farm until my early twenties, my roots are in the land, and I feel as much a sense of identity as a farmer as I do a scholar, educator, or activist.<br><br> Some of my earliest recollections are of lying on the living room floor and watching sunbeams pouring through a window and moving across the rug, their golden rays bringing a living presence and nurturing aliveness into the room. As a young man, farm life brought me the gift of deep silence in a setting where subtle ecstasies would regularly blossom: the smell of freshly mown hay, the fragrance of dry earth moistened by a brief summer shower, the Sun setting over distant mountains. When alone, I would sometimes lie down in a furrow to experience the earth and the sea of flourishing crops. I recall lying down in a field of lettuce, nearly covered by its abundant leaves, and absorbing the humming aliveness of the earth, the fields, and the sky above me. Irrigating crops, pruning apple trees, tending farm animals&#x2014;these were regular invitations to celebrate nature&#x2019;s miracle of luminous aliveness. Like water seeping into a dry sponge, over many seasons a nameless and palpable presence gradually permeated me.<br><br> In my early twenties I moved to the city, where I felt a deep separation from the familiar aliveness of my farming days. In 1971, I was working in Washington, D.C., as a senior staff member of a joint presidential-congressional commission on the American future. Thoughts about the aliveness of nature were set aside as we focused on the next thirty years and issues of population growth, urbanization, and the shortage of critical resources like water. Although intuitions of a living universe still resonated within me, in the intense world of politics they seemed a soft sensibility to be disregarded. Still, I was conflicted. Was the living presence I experienced on the farm in Idaho just my imagination? Or, did the invisible aliveness permeate even the coarse world of Washington politics? How important was something so hard to grasp and yet so rich with felt experience?<br><br> After two years in Washington and disillusioned with the politics of power, I wanted a fresh start. With my family I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and began to work with a small team of senior researchers in the &#x201c;futures group&#x201d; of SRI International, one of the largest think tanks in the world. For the next five years, we studied the long-range future for both government agencies and corporations. During this time I co-authored the book Changing Images of Man with a small team that included the eminent scholar Joseph Campbell. Our research explored archetypal images that serve as beacons to guide the human family into the future. Another project involved a yearlong study of future global problems for the president&#x2019;s science advisor. Still another project for the Environmental Protection Agency involved looking ahead twenty-five years and projecting an array of alternative scenarios and their implications for U.S. environmental policy. All of this research led me to the stark realization that our world is moving into a time of profound change in the ways we live on the Earth and see the universe, ourselves, and the human journey.<br><br> While engaged in researching the long-range future, I was also involved in an intense meditation practice grounded in Tibetan Buddhism. Then, in an unexpected turn of events, I became a subject in the earliest psychic research at SRI on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. These scientific experiments gave me a way to explore over a period of nearly three years, in my direct experience, the fundamental question raised here: Is the universe a living system? Combining intensive meditation with equally intensive laboratory experimentation gave me an unusual learning opportunity. This book is grounded in the confidence of these years of combined inner and outer inquiry.<br><br> The SRI research on the global future made it emphatically clear that the world would soon encounter unyielding limits to current levels and patterns of growth. Seeing this, I wanted to do more than watch from the sidelines of history, so I left SRI in order to meditate and advocate for creative change.<br><br> Meditation took the form of a half-year of self-directed reflection and contemplation in my cottage. This culminated in a transformative experience that has reverberated through my life ever since (described in my book Awakening Earth, Appendix II). Insights from this half-year of meditation are reflected throughout this book.<br><br> My advocacy for change has included writing three editions of the book Voluntary Simplicity and speaking around the world on themes of building a sustainable future. I&#x2019;ve also co-founded three non-profit organizations doing non-partisan work for media accountability and citizen empowerment.<br><br> Looking back, these diverse life experiences have given me a range of perspectives for looking at the world. So far, I have lived in at least three different perceptual paradigms. I grew up in the mindset of the agrarian era&#x2014;on a farm where the experience of life was dominated by the seasons and cycles of nature. I then moved into the mindset of the industrial era as I watched our family farm grow into a small agribusiness and we moved from the farm into a nearby town. I then moved into the mindset of the communications era when I began doing research on long-range futures and advocating for a more conscious democracy. I&#x2019;ve seen how each paradigm develops logically from the last, and each has its unique way of regarding the world and one&#x2019;s self.<br><br> Like myself, I believe many people may be living with a foot in at least two worlds: straddling two or more different paradigms of perception and struggling to make sense of the universe. Perhaps you, like me, feel pulled between opening with vulnerability to the subtle aliveness of the natural world and protecting your experience of aliveness from the deadness of a materially obsessed culture.<br><br> Before exploring the idea of a living universe, it is important to acknowledge its antithesis&#x2014;an extreme view that regards the universe as non-living or dead at its foundations. I believe that seeing the universe as mostly dead matter, empty space, and devoid of life represents an important stage in humanity&#x2019;s individuation and empowerment. I also believe this is not the whole story, just one chapter in a much larger story of our awakening&#x2014;and eventual return&#x2014;to a living universe.<br> Living in a Dead Universe<br><br> For perspective, it is important to look carefully at the perceptual paradigm of a dead universe. Particularly in the world of science, it is not uncommon to encounter the view that we live in a universe that, at its foundation, lacks feeling, consciousness, and vitality. This view is clearly expressed, for example, by Susan Blackmore, an author on human consciousness, who said: &#x201c;We live in a pointless universe. We&#x2019;re here for no reason at all. There isn&#x2019;t a soul. There isn&#x2019;t a spirit. We&#x2019;re not going to live forever in some kind of heaven . . . there are no paranormal phenomena, although I can&#x2019;t be sure of that.&#x201d;2<br><br> Blackmore provides a stark description of a non-living or dead universe&#x2014;and she is not alone.3 This has been the established view of many scientists for three centuries. For more than 300 years, science has viewed the physical universe as &#x201c;all there is&#x201d;: all that exists are various combinations of inert matter and to suggest otherwise is to regress into superstition. Matter, at the atomic level, is assumed to lack any kind of inherent vitality. In turn, aliveness, thought, and feelings are phenomena that mysteriously arise when matter evolves to high levels of complexity in its physical organization and creates beings like ourselves. All of existence is explained solely in material terms (except for the part about life spontaneously organizing itself and becoming conscious of itself). There appears to be no need for an invisible consciousness because the workings of the entire universe are explained through the workings of matter. Because human aliveness, thought, and feeling are assumed to have emerged from chemical reactions between non-living matter, the death of the physical body is seen as the end of consciousness. Understandably, in this view of the universe, more &#x201c;basic&#x201d; forms of matter (atoms and molecules) are thought to have no vitality or consciousness of any kind.<br><br> If the foundations of the universe are regarded as non-living, then &#x201c;life&#x201d; seems to have emerged only recently as matter somehow managed to organize itself into ever-higher levels of complexity&#x2014;evolving from atoms to molecules to cells to organisms. Consciousness, or a knowing capacity, is viewed as a biological phenomena located in the physical brain.<br><br> If we assume the universe is non-living and without sentience at its foundations, it is natural to further assume there is no higher purpose or meaning to life. Love and happiness are no more than chemical reactions in the body and have no other meaning or significance. There is no prospect of a future beyond our physical existence. Because the universe will disperse and the stars burn out, all life will eventually die off and be forgotten, meaning nothing. Material possessions and accomplishments are the primary expression of one&#x2019;s identity, and thus an important source of happiness.<br><br> In this matter-only view of the universe, it is only logical to conclude that the most intensely living (we humans) have the right to exploit that which is dead (matter and the rest of nature) for our own purposes. Nature is our warehouse, filled with resources for our use. How should we relate to the world? By exploiting that which is dead (nature) on behalf of the living (ourselves). A tendency toward materialism, hedonism, and the exploitation of nature are predictable outcomes from a dead-universe perspective.<br><br> Despite its bleak outlook, a dead-universe perspective represents a critically important stage in humanity&#x2019;s long journey of awakening. In pulling back from nature and pulling apart from one another, we have also become much stronger and more differentiated as individuals. My sense is that we humans have separated ourselves as far from union with nature as we will ever go. Now we have little choice: If we are to continue to evolve and realize our potentials as a species, we must become conscious of our partnership with nature and one another.<br><br> Although the transition to industrial society and hyper-rationalism have largely severed it, I believe we are opening to a new level of connection with nature, particularly in science. From the electron microscope to the Hubble telescope to the human genome, we are tran...</p><h2>Whose Monet?: An Introduction to the American Legal System (Introduction to Law Series)</h2><p>This extraordinary paperback provides a highly accessible and appealing orientation to the American legal system and presents basic concepts of civil litigation to first-year law students. &lt;b&gt;Whose Monet?

Or that Jerome Robbins never choreographed the famous "Dance at the Gym" in <em>West Side Story</em>? Or that Lin-Manuel Miranda called out an audience member on Twitter for texting during a performance of Hamilton (the perpetrator was Madonna)? In <em>Show and Tell: The New Book of Broadway Anecdotes</em>, Broadway aficionado-in-chief Ken Bloom takes us on a spirited spin through some of the most intriguing factoids in show business, offering up an unconventional history of the theatre in all its idiosyncratic glory. From the cantankerous retorts of George Abbott to the literally show-stopping antics of Katharine Hepburn, you'll learn about the adventures and star turns of some of the Broadway's biggest personalities, and discover little-known tidbits about beloved plays and musicals from <em>The Black Crook</em> to <em>Beautiful</em>.<br></p><p><br>Ken Bloom is the author of <em>Broadway Musicals: The 101 Greatest Shows of All Time</em> and <em>Broadway: An Encyclopedia</em>.

They support the cultivation of agriculture and livestock, and they are also are also integral to the ecosystem. And, in many locations across Switzerland, they are in need of restoration by those with a thorough understanding of their roles and vast range of types and purposes.<br><br> Drawing on the copious research and practice of the Swiss Environmental Action Fund, <i>Dry Stone Walls</i> is a uniquely comprehensive work on the topic, combining cultural history with a guide to plants and animals that find their habitat in such structures and a practical, step-by-step manual to the building and maintenance of dry stone walls. Richly illustrated with more than four hundred photographs and drawings, including many in color, the book contains a wealth of advice for both the planning of new dry stone walls and the care of existing ones, as well as information on structural analysis and the organization of building sites. The book will serve as a guide for future generations everywhere to this ancient practice that is in danger of extinction.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 1976, the <b>Swiss Environmental Action Fund </b>is dedicated to the conservation and preservation of Swiss nature and landscapes.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Mwindo Epic from the Banyanga (Zaire)</h2><p>The feats of the hero Mwindo are here glorified in the bilingual text of an epic which was sung and narrated in a Bantu language and acted out by a member of the Nyanga tribe in the remote forest regions of eastern Zaire.

Fisher: A Life in Letters : Correspondence 1929-1991</h2><p>STATED FIRST PRINTING. 1997 Counterpoint hardcover, M. F. K. Fisher (The Art of Eating: 50th Anniversary Edition). Jointly selected and edited by cultural/food critic Fisher&#39;s younger sister, a longtime secretary, and a personal friend and published here for the first time, these letters?literally hundreds of them?were written from either California (Whittier, Sonoma, and Napa) or Europe (mostly France). Frequent correspondents include Julia Child, librarian and scholar Lawrence Clark Powell (who contributed a preface), and various family members, among many others. Brief section introductions and photographs provide what little context is needed. At the onset, Fisher&#39;s writing is accomplished; the letters are brimming with details not only of food but clothing, surroundings, people, and the like. Fisher produced 26 books, and this volume should accompany them in almost all libraries.?Janice E. Braun, Mills Coll., Oakland, Cal. - Amazon</p><p>What is the spell that M.F.K. Fisher casts over enchanted readers who, privileged, dip into her timeless culinary masterworks and occasional fiction? With this volume of never-before-published letters, fans who know M.F.K. only by such gustatory marvels as <i>The Art of Eating</i> and <i>How to Cook a Wolf</i> may now draw closer to the life--the loves and loves lost, the travails and travels--that inspired this woman of unique appetites, wit, and tastes. <p> In 1929, shortly after she turned 21, Mary Frances Kennedy married Alfred Young Fisher, and together they sallied forth to France. There her senses were freed, her artist's eye and culinary tastes refined, and she began a correspondence with family and friends that would become the raw material for many books to come; those first three years in southern France sharpened her eye for the telling moment, the curious detail. </p><p> This compendious collection of letters (which includes 32 pages of photos from her family collection) is divided into chronological blocks, introduced by brief biographical synopses. But nothing relates Fisher's rich life as poignantly as the voice that graces her letters: "Things go well here," she wrote in February 1950, having returned to the decrepit family ranch in California to care for her dying father and support her two daughters, "and the new cook, a quiet firm motherly farm-woman, promises to be just about what we need (...although I am still shuddering at one of our opening remarks, when I told her we all like to eat lots of fresh vegetables and she said, 'Oh, ja... t'ings like potato pancakes and sauerkraut...')." </p><p> Anne Lamott's tender forward to <i>A Life in Letters</i> is a panegyric in recognition of M.F.K. Fisher's shameless delight in and worship of earth's bounty, a balm to our fat-phobic, diet-dazed sensibilities. "She was," Lamott writes, "just about the last of the food people who did not get caught up in any modern madness, insisting instead on staying in the luxuriousness of taste and texture and communion." As these letters prove, it was a good recipe for a long life, filled with grace and gratitude.</p>Her cunning as a culinary essayist, memoirist, and fiction writer won't fully prepare Fisher's many fans for her gusto as an informal correspondent. The long-lived Californian (190892), whose more than two dozen books (To Begin Again, 1992, etc.) also chronicled her extended stays in Provence and other parts of Europe, wrote letters with the sort of committed &#x201a;lan that some authors reserve solely for their published books and articles. Thankfully, though, Fisher seemed to find herself with special joy as a writer when writing to someone. The more than 60 years covered by these letters offer a changeable, charming, and unself-conscious portrait of the writer by her own highly skilled hand. They also vividly suggest the shifts in opportunities for American women as the decades passed in this century. Unlike her previously published writing, the letters are less often travelogues or sensuous surveys of adventures in appetite than they are a gathering chorus of Fisher's monologues about her family, her marriages (three), her friends, the work of writing, the business of publishing and other good reasons to live for as long as possible. Her correspondents here include Julia Child, James Beard, longtime Esquire editor Arnold Gingrich, and Knopf editor Judith Jones. Yet mainly she wrote to people who weren't famous, and her arena mostly wasn't all that worldly. Nor was her life especially privileged, despite the suggested enchantments of her sentences. Fisher seemed to take charge of any catastrophe falling on those near to her; a large part of the record shows her fighting valiantly and generously on their behalf, perhaps with a touch of inherited masochism. At the same time, however, she could insist on freedoms for herself that were not then fashionable, and with exhilarating gumption. So much to inspire; too much to summarize.

Why, she asks, when writers such as Samuel Clemens, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Saul Bellow, and John Updike have among them written hundreds of short stories, do anthologists settle on the same two or three titles by each author again and again? "Isn't the implicit promise of an anthology that it will, or aspires to, present something different, unexpected?"<br> In <em>The Oxford Book of American Short Stories</em>, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of fifty-six tales that combines classic works with many "different, unexpected" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers. Some selections simply can't be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving's "Rip Van Winkle," Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart," and Hemingway's "A Clean, Well-Lighted Place." But alongside these classics, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain's "Cannibalism in the Cars," a story that reveals a darker side to his humor ("That morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to...a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy"). From Melville come the juxtaposed tales "The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids," of which Oates says, "Only Melville could have fashioned out of 'real' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction." From Flannery O'Connor we find "A Late Encounter With the Enemy," and from John Cheever, "The Death of Justina," one of Cheever's own favorites, though rarely anthologized. The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston. Contemporary artists abound, including Bharati Mukherjee and Amy Tan, Alice Adams and David Leavitt, Bobbie Ann Mason and Tim O'Brien, Louise Erdrich and John Edgar Wideman. Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work, plus a long introductory essay, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master.<br> This then is a book of surprises, a fascinating portrait of American short fiction, as filtered through the sensibility of a major modern writer.</p><p><br><strong>Joyce Carol Oates</strong> is one of America's preeminent writers. Since 1978, she has been on the faculty of Princeton University and is a co-editor of <em>The Ontario Review</em>.<br>"Provides a history of not only the evolution of the short story, but also of American culture....The collection is more than a survey of writing styles. It is a celebration of the diversity of American culture."--Denver Post<br><br>"Joyce Carol Oates has cast her net further and deeper, drawing from American literature's impressive past and substantial cultural wealth....Exceptional."--Booklist<br><br>"Readers who take an encompassing view of American literature and culture will love this book, which brilliantly captures the range and heft of the remarkable American contribution to the short story genre. With penetrating introductions by Joyce Carol Oates to each writer, this is an<br>anthology of the finest kind, a collection of stories dazzling in variety but unified by an editor of singular intelligence and vision."--Arnold Rampersad, Princeton University<br><br>"Joyce Carol Oates, a master fabulist who is also one of our finest critics, has given us a treasury that represents the astonishing range of the American short story. But instead of another showcase of 'greatest hits,' Oates ventures further afield, to uncover a series of neglected but<br>refulgent gems. This is a collection with guts--and brains. Best of all, it's a collection that unfolds, as its editor promises, the larger story of American writing, in all its hues and timbres."--Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Harvard University<br><br>"Whether for the classroom or the bedtable, The Oxford Book of American Short Stories is indispensable, the best fiction selected and introduced by one of America's finest writers.

Frye identifies four key elements found in the Bible-the mountain, the garden, the cave, and the furnace-and describes how they recur in later secular writings. Indices.<br></p><p>Northrop Frye (1912-1991) was professor emeritus at Victoria College, University of Toronto, and the author of many books on literary theory and criticism.Frye (1912-1991) analyzes the Bible's imagery, narrative structure and influence upon literary classics in his tremendously rich sequel to The Great Code: The Bible and Literature . (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>In his introduction to The Great Code ( LJ 6/1/82), Frye promised a sequel to his work on "the Bible and literature." Here is the promised volume, though it is not an entirely new book. In Part 1, Frye restates his critical position, his structural principle: the identity of mythology and literature. In Part 2, he focuses on specific mythological themes (mountain, garden, cave, furnace) that are variations of the cosmic axis mundi image. Throughout, he demonstrates his interest in the mythological structures that inform literature, including the Bible, instead of simply the literary characteristics of the Bible. While it is undeniable that myths often serve as structuring elements in the Bible, occasionally Frye allows myth criticism to overwhelm the text rather than shed light upon it. Thus there is the risk of forcing the text into the pre-established structure. This aside, there is enlightenment available for readers willing to work through it. Recommended.<br><i>- Craig W.

This is water to which people are increasingly turning to find innovative solutions to water scarcity, pollution, aquifer depletion and other problems that are assuming center stage in local and global politics, dynamics, and fears. It is also water that is celebrated and ritualized in ordinary and everyday practices across many cultures. The book brings together the work of eminent professionals, designers, artists, scientists and theorists, who respond to the challenges that this water poses, its visualization, its infrastructure, its politics and its science. At a moment when design disciplines are beginning to embrace measures such as flexibility, agility and resilience, this book makes an important and timely contribution. These are measures that we associate more closely with water and watery imagination than the terra firma that grounds aspirations of prediction and control that have proved elusive, perhaps even detrimental. The book asks if in this time of uncertainty and ambiguity brought on by increasing openness of economies, cultures, and ecologies, we need to re-invent our relationship with water. Should we look to the past, present and future and ask if in seeing water somewhere rather than everywhere we miss opportunities, practices and lessons that could inform and transform the design project? What role has representation and visualization played in confining water to a place on land? Can we look at projects in history and projects emerging today - cities, infrastructures, buildings, landscapes, artworks - with a cultivated eye for waters everywhere? What is it to see water as not within, adjoining, serving or threatening settlement, but the ground of settlement? Design in the Terrain of Water is a collection of visual and textual essays that present a way, a direction, and perhaps even a paradigm shift in how professionals imagine, build, and advocate in a terrain of water.</p><p>Design in the Terrain of Water was envisioned and edited by Anuradha Mathur and Dilip da Cunha, professors at the School of Design, University of Pennsylvania. An underlying thread in their work is a concern for how water is visualized and engaged in ways that lead to conditions of its excess and scarcity, but also the opportunities that its presence and fluidity offers for new visualizations of terrain, design imagination, and design practice.

For these posters, Mucha created a distinctive style characterized by harmonious compositions, sinuous forms and a muted palette, which became synonymous with the newly emerging decorative style of the time&#x2015;Art Nouveau. By the time of the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, Mucha had become a leading figure in this decorative-art movement, and he defined the look of the era.

Index.<br></p><p>Personal-finance guru Andrew Tobias slams online trading and praises the Roth IRA in his newly revised <i>The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need</i>. This investment bible remains as stimulating and meaningful as it was when it was first published 20 years ago. It's packed with ideas about stocks, living beneath your means, tax planning, retirement, and just about everything else in the financial world. And all of it is presented with Tobias's trademark brevity and ingenuity.<p> Last revised in 1995, the guide takes aim at a new game in town--online trading. By all means, use the Internet for buying a car or for research, Tobias says. But avoid cyberspace brokers, he says. Point and click enough and you will get slaughtered by commissions, spreads, taxes, and human nature. "It's so easy to click 'OK' a few times and make a $10,000 bet," he warns. "Look how mesmerized we become on a stool in front of a slot machine. Internet investing positively teases you to play." Tobias's favorite new entry is the Roth IRA, which allows you to withdraw your money tax-free when you retire. It's far better than a traditional IRA, he asserts. "Save yourself the trouble of agonizing over the choice and go with the Roth IRA," he writes. "Forget the worksheets." Sometimes caustic and always a skeptic, Tobias believes readers can shape their own financial futures. Just stick to the basics, he says. "By and large, you should manage your own money, via no-load mutual funds," he writes. "No one is going to care about it as much as you." It doesn't matter if it's 1978, 1998, or even 2008. <i>The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need</i> still is exactly that.

Drawing on his own experience, rich archival material, and a keen sense of history and politics, Mikhail Gorbachev speaks his mind on a range of subjects concerning Russia's past, present, and future place in the world. Here is Gorbachev on the October Revolution, Gorbachev on the Cold War, and Gorbachev on key figures such as Lenin, Stalin, and Yeltsin. <br><br>The book begins with a look back at 1917. While noting that tsarist Russia was not as backward as it is often portrayed, Gorbachev argues that the Bolshevik Revolution was inevitable and that it did much to modernize Russia. He strongly argues that the Soviet Union had a positive influence on social policy in the West, while maintaining that the development of socialism was cut short by Stalinist totalitarianism. In the next section, Gorbachev considers the fall of the USSR. What were the goals of perestroika? How did such a vast superpower disintegrate so quickly? From the awakening of ethnic tensions, to the inability of democrats to unite, to his own attempts to reform but preserve the union, Gorbachev retraces those fateful days and explains the origins of Russia's present crisis. <br><br>But Gorbachev does not just train his critical eye on the past. He lays out a blueprint for where Russia needs to go in the next century, suggesting ways to strengthen the federation and achieve meaningful economic and political reforms. In the final section of the book, Gorbachev examines the "new thinking" in foreign policy that helped to end the Cold War and shows how such approaches could help resolve a range of current crises, including NATO expansion, the role of the UN, the fate of nuclear weapons, and environmental problems.<br><br><i>Gorbachev: On My Country and the World</i> reveals the unique vision of a man who was a powerful actor on the world stage and remains a keen observer of Russia's experience in the twentieth century.</p><p>Here is the whole sweep of the Soviet experiment and experience, as told by its last steward.

Although onset of Huntington's Disease usually occurs in adulthood, the age of onset of the condition is extremely variable with approximately 5-10% of cases having an onset of less than 20 years, or Juvenile Huntington's Disease (JHD). While JHD shares many of the clinical features of adult HD (e.g., chorea and personality disorders), patients with JHD often experience additional problems including seizures, dystonia, and Parkinsonism. Diagnosis in patients with JHD is often delayed because of the failure of clinicians to recognize the characteristic features of the condition. While several textbooks have been published on HD, no books have been published to date focusing solely on the juvenile onset form of the disease.

These changes include climate; the chemical c- position of the atmosphere; the demands of a growing human population for food and ?ber; and the mobility of organisms, ind- trial products, cultural perspectives, and information ?ows. The magnitude and widespread nature of these changes pose serious challenges in managing the ecosystem services on which society depends. Moreover, many of these changes are strongly in?uenced by human activities, so future patterns of change will continue to be in?uenced by society&#x2019;s choices and governance. The purpose of this book is to provide a new framework for n- ural resource management&#x2015;a framework based on stewardship of ecosystems for human well-being in a world dominated by unc- tainty and change. The goal of ecosystem stewardship is to respond to and shape change in social-ecological systems in order to s- tain the supply and opportunities for use of ecosystem services by society. The book links recent advances in the theory of resilience, sustainability, and vulnerability with practical issues of ecosystem management and governance. The book is aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students of natural resource management as well as professional managers, community leaders, and policy makers with backgrounds in a wide array of d- ciplines, including ecology, policy studies, economics, sociology, and anthropology.</p><p><p>Natural resource management is entering a new era in which rapid environmental and social changes inevitably alter ecosystems and the benefits they provide to society. This textbook provides a new framework for natural resource management&#x2015;a framework based on stewardship of ecosystems for ecological integrity and human well-being in a world dominated by uncertainty and change. The goal of ecosystem stewardship is to respond to and shape changes in social-ecological systems in order to sustain the supply and availability of ecosystem services by society. The book links recent advances in the theory of resilience, sustainability, and vulnerability with practical issues of ecosystem management and governance. Chapters by leading experts then illustrate these principles in major social-ecological systems of the world. Inclusion of review questions, glossary, and suggestions for additional reading makes <em>Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship: Resilience-Based Natural Resource Management in a Changing World</em> particularly suitable for use in all courses of resource management, resource ecology, sustainability science, and the human dimensions of global change. Professional resource managers, policy makers, leaders of NGOs, and researchers will find this novel synthesis a valuable tool in developing strategies for a more sustainable planet.</p> <p>About the Authors:</p> <p>F.

While the statistical tools presented in this book are applicable to data from medicine, biology, public health, epidemiology, engineering, economics, and demography, the focus here is on applications of the techniques to biology and medicine. The analysis of survival experiments is complicated by issues of censoring, where an individual's life length is known to occur only in a certain period of time, and by truncation, where individuals enter the study only if they survive a sufficient length of time or individuals are included in the study only if the event has occurred by a given date. The use of counting process methodology has allowed for substantial advances in the statistical theory to account for censoring and truncation in survival experiments. This book makes these complex methods more accessible to applied researchers without an advanced mathematical background. The authors present the essence of these techniques, as well as classical techniques not based on counting processes, and apply them to data. <p>Practical suggestions for implementing the various methods are set off in a series of Practical Notes at the end of each section. Technical details of the derivation of the techniques are sketched in a series of Technical Notes. </p><p>This book will be useful for investigators who need to analyze censored or truncated life time data, and as a textbook for a graduate course in survival analysis. The prerequisite is a standard course in statistical methodology. </p><p>"This book...offers an excellent course in survival analysis for Masters-level students or indeed for statisticians who wish to extend their knowledge of this subject...The authors treat the subject from a classical point of view and the mathematical level is compatible with that. A brief review of the alternative development of the subject through counting processes is given in Chapter 3 and further references and discussion are given in the theoretical notes that are part of each chapter. The subject is developed mathematically, but strong emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of the techniques. Included in each chapter are practical notes that extend the theoretical developments in the text and discuss relevant computer programs." (Short Book Reviews)</p></p><p>The book is ideal for a one-semester course on applied survival analysis.

In this compelling collection, Amy Greenberg focuses on the social, cultural and political context that gave rise to Manifest Destiny. She explores how American expansionism evolved from its colonial roots and accompanying notions of exceptionalism to become a fully articulated rationale in the 1840s for expanding the nation&#x2019;s borders and seizing lands from Native Americans and Mexico and later from Cuba and Central America. Documents &#x2014; including diary and personal narratives, letters, political speeches, contemporary illustrations, newspaper accounts, essays, appeals, and a song &#x2014; highlight the origin of the term itself, ideological support and rejection of Manifest Destiny, and the voices of those most painfully affected by American expansion.

SMA Bulletin</p><h2>Madame Bovary (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p><b>A new translation by Adam Thorpe</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Gustave Flaubert once said of his heroine, &#x201c;Emma Bovary, c&#x2019;est moi.&#x201d; In this acclaimed new translation, Adam Thorpe brings readers closer than ever before to Flaubert&#x2019;s peerless text and, by extension, the author himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Emma, a passionate dreamer raised in the French countryside, is ready for her life to take off when she marries the decent, dull Dr. Charles Bovary. Marriage, however, fails to live up to her expectations, which are fueled by sentimental novels, and she turns disastrously to love affairs. The story of Emma&#x2019;s adultery scandalized France when <i>Madame Bovary</i> was first published.&nbsp;Today, the heartbreaking story of Emma&#x2019;s financial ruin remains just as compelling. Translator Adam Thorpe, an accomplished author in his own right, pays careful attention to the &#x201c;complex music&#x201d; of Flaubert&#x2019;s language, with its elegant, finely wrought sentences and closely observed detail. This exquisite Modern Library edition is sure to set a new standard for an enduring classic. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for Adam Thorpe&#x2019;s translation of <i>Madame Bovary</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;What leaves me reeling with each rereading (and Adam Thorpe&#x2019;s new translation is, pardon the pun, to die for) is the use of language. There can be no doubt as to the reason for Flaubert&#x2019;s brain popping at the top of the stairs when he was fifty-eight. He broke it scouring for perfect sentences, words, le mot juste.&#x201d;&#x2014;Russell Kane, <i>The Independent</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Flaubert described his great work as a poem, so it is fitting that a poet and novelist of Thorpe&#x2019;s stature should turn his hand to it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robin Robertson, <i>The Herald</i> (Scotland)</p><p><b>Adam Thorpe</b> was born in Paris in 1956. His first novel, <i>Ulverton</i>, was published in 1992, and he has written nine others&#x2014;most recently <i>Flight</i>&#x2014;along with two collections of stories and five books of poetry. He lives in France with his wife and family.Part One<br><br>We were in study hall when the headmaster walked in, followed by a new boy not wearing a school uniform, and by a janitor carrying a large desk. Those who were sleeping awoke, and we all stood up as though interrupting our work.<br><br>The headmaster motioned us to sit down, then turned to the teacher and said softly, "Monsieur Roger, I'm placing this pupil in your care. He'll begin in the eighth grade, but if his work and conduct are good enough, he'll be promoted to where he ought to be at his age."<br><br>The newcomer hung back in the corner behind the door, so that we could hardly see him. He was a country boy of about fifteen, taller than any of us. He wore his hair cut straight across the forehead, like a cantor in a village church, and he had a gentle, bewildered look. Although his shoulders were not broad, his green jacket with black buttons was apparently too tight under the arms, and the slits of its cuffs revealed red wrists accustomed to being bare. His legs, sheathed in blue stockings, protruded from his yellowish trousers, which were pulled up tight by a pair of suspenders. He wore heavy, unpolished, hobnailed shoes.<br><br>We began to recite our lessons. He concentrated all his attention on them, as though listening to a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean on his elbow, and when the bell rang at two o'clock the teacher had to tell him to line up with the rest of us.<br><br>When we entered a classroom we always tossed our caps on the floor, to free our hands; as soon as we crossed the threshold we would throw them under the bench so hard that they struck the wall and raised a cloud of dust; this was "the way it should be done."<br><br>But the new boy either failed to notice this maneuver or was too shy to perform it himself, for he was still holding his cap on his lap at the end of the prayer. It was a head-gear of composite nature, combining elements of the busby, the lancer cap, the round hat, the otter-skin cap and the cotton nightcap--one of those wretched things whose mute ugliness has great depths of expression, like an idiot's face. Egg-shaped and stiffened by whalebone, it began with three rounded bands, followed by alternating diamond-shaped patches of velvet and rabbit fur separated by a red stripe, and finally there was a kind of bag terminating in a cardboard-lined polygon covered with complicated braid. A network of gold wire was attached to the top of this polygon by a long, extremely thin cord, forming a kind of tassel. The cap was new; its visor was shiny.<br><br>"Stand up," said the teacher.<br><br>He stood up; his cap fell. The whole class began to laugh. <br><br>He bent down and picked it up. A boy beside him knocked it down again with his elbow; he picked it up once again.<br><br>"Will you please put your helmet away?" said the teacher, a witty man.<br><br>A loud burst of laughter from the other pupils threw the poor boy into such a state of confusion that he did not know whether to hold his cap in his hand, leave it on the floor or put it on his head. He sat down again and put it back on his lap.<br><br>"Stand up," said the teacher, "and tell me your name."<br><br>The new boy mumbled something unintelligible.<br><br>"Say it again!"<br><br>The same mumbled syllables came from his lips again, drowned out by the jeers of the class.<br><br>"Louder!" cried the teacher. "Louder!"<br><br>With desperate determination the new boy opened his enormous mouth and, as though calling someone, shouted this word at the top of his lungs: "Charbovari!"<br><br>This instantly touched off an uproar which rose in a crescendo of shrill exclamations, shrieks, barks, stamping of feet and repeated shouts of "Charbovari! Charbovari!" Then it subsided into isolated notes, but it was a long time before it died down completely; it kept coming back to life in fits and starts along a row of desks where a stifled laugh would occasionally explode like a half-spent firecracker.<br><br>A shower of penalties gradually restored order in the classroom, however, and the teacher, having managed to understand Charles Bovary's name after making him repeat it, spell it out and read it to him, immediately ordered the poor devil to sit on the dunce's seat at the foot of the rostrum. He began to walk over to it, then stopped short.<br><br>"What are you looking for?" asked the teacher.<br><br>"My ca--" the new boy said timidly, glancing around uneasily."<br><br>The whole class will copy five hundred lines!" Like Neptune's "Quos ego" in the Aeneid, this furious exclamation checked the outbreak of a new storm. "Keep quiet!" continued the teacher indignantly, mopping his forehead with a handkerchief he had taken from his toque. "As for you," he said to the new boy, "you will write out 'Ridiculus sum' twenty times in all tenses." He added, in a gentler tone, "Don't worry, you'll find your cap: it hasn't been stolen."<br><br>Everything became calm again. Heads bent over notebooks, and for the next two hours the new boy's conduct was exemplary, despite the spitballs, shot from the nib of a pen, that occasionally splattered against his face. He merely wiped himself with his hand each time this happened, then continued to sit motionless, with his eyes lowered.<br><br>That evening, in study hall, he took sleeveguards from his desk, put his things in order and carefully ruled his paper. We saw him working conscientiously, looking up all the words in the dictionary and taking great pains with everything he did. It was no doubt because of this display of effort that he was not placed in a lower grade, for, while he had a passable knowledge of grammatical rules, his style was without elegance. He had begun to study Latin with his village priest, since his parents, to save money, had postponed sending him off to school as long as possible.<br><br>His father, Monsieur Charles-Denis-Bartholom� Bovary, had once been an assistant surgeon in the army. Forced to leave the service in 1812 for corrupt practices with regard to conscription, he had taken advantage of his masculine charms to pick up a dowry of sixty thousand francs being offered to him in the person of a hosier's daughter who had fallen in love with his appearance. He was a handsome, boastful man who liked to rattle his spurs; his side whiskers joined his mustache, his fingers were always adorned with rings and he wore bright-colored clothes. He had the look of a pimp and the affable exuberance of a traveling salesman. He lived on his wife's money for the first two or three years of their marriage, eating well, getting up late, smoking big porcelain pipes, staying out every night to see a show and spending a great deal of time in caf�s. His father-in-law died and left very little; indignant at this, he "went into the textile business" and lost some money, then he moved to the country, where he intended to "build up a going concern." But since he knew little more about farming than he did about calico, since he rode his horses instead of sending them off to work in the fields, drank his bottled cider instead of selling it, ate the finest poultry in his barnyard and greased his hunting shoes with the fat of his pigs, he soon realized that he would do well to give up all thought of business endeavor.<br><br>So for two hundred francs a year he rented a residence that was half farm and half gentleman's estate, on the border between Picardy and the Caux region of Normandy. Melancholy, consumed with regrets, cursing heaven, envious of everyone, he withdrew into seclusion at the age of forty-five, disgusted with mankind, he said, and resolved to live in peace.<br><br>His wife had been mad about him in the beginning; she had loved him with a boundless servility that made him even more indifferent to her. She had been vivacious, expansive and brimming over with affection in her youth, but as she grew older she became peevish, nagging and nervous, like sour wine turning to vinegar. She had suffered so much at first without complaining, watching him run after every village strumpet in sight and having him come home to her every night, satiated and stinking of alcohol, after carousing in a score of ill-famed establishments! Then her pride rebelled; she withdrew into herself, swallowing her rage with a mute stoicism which she maintained until her death. She was always busy with domestic and financial matters. She was constantly going to see lawyers or the judge, remembering when notes were due and obtaining renewals; and at home she spent all her time ironing, sewing, washing, supervising the workmen and settling the itemized bills they presented to her, while Monsieur, totally unconcerned with everything and continually sinking into a sullen drowsiness from which he roused himself only to make disagreeable remarks to her, sat smoking beside the fire and spitting into the ashes.<br><br>When she had a child it had to be placed in the care of a wet-nurse. The boy was pampered like a prince when he came back to live with them. His mother fed him on jam and candied fruit; his father let him run barefoot and even carried his philosophical pretensions to the point of saying that he might as well go naked, like a young animal. In opposition to his wife's maternal tendencies, he had a certain virile ideal of childhood, and he tried to form his son in accordance with it. He wanted him to be raised harshly, Spartan-style, in order to give him a sturdy constitution. He sent him to bed without a fire, taught him to take hearty swigs of rum and to jeer at religious processions. But, placid by nature, the child showed little response to his father's efforts. His mother kept him tied to her apron-strings; she cut out cardboard figures for him, told him stories and talked to him in endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety and wheedling chatter. In the isolation of her life she transferred all her shattered, abandoned ambitions to her child. She dreamed of high positions, she saw him already grown up, handsome and witty, making a successful career for himself in the Department of Civil Engineering or the magistracy. She taught him to read and even to sing two or three sentimental songs, using an old piano she had. But Monsieur Bovary, who cared little for culture, maintained that such things were "a waste of time." Would they ever have enough money to put him through the government schools, buy him a government position or set him up in business? Besides, "a man could always get ahead in life if he had enough nerve." Madame Bovary bit her lips and the boy continued to run wild in the village.<br><br>He tagged after the farmhands and drove the crows away by throwing clods of earth at them. He ate the blackberries growing along the ditches, kept watch over the turkeys with a long stick, pitched hay during harvest time, wandered through the woods, played hopscotch under the church porch on rainy days and, on important holidays, begged the sexton to let him toll the bells, so that he could hang his whole body on the thick rope and feel it lift him into the air when the bells were ringing in full peal.<br><br>Thus he grew like an oak. He acquired strong hands and a healthy complexion.<br><br>When he was twelve his mother succeeded in arranging for him to begin his education. The village priest agreed to give him lessons. But they were so short and irregular that they accomplished very little. The priest gave them in the sacristy, at odd moments, between a christening and a funeral, hurriedly, without even sitting down; or else he sent for his pupil after the Angelus, on evenings when he did not have to go out. They would go up to his bedroom and set to work while the gnats and moths flew around the candle. It was warm there; the boy would fall asleep and the old man, his hands folded over his stomach, would soon doze off and begin snoring with his mouth open. At other times, when the priest was on his way back to the village after giving the Eucharist to some sick person in the vicinity, he would catch sight of Charles frolicking in the fields, call him over, lecture him for several minutes and take advantage of the opportunity to make him conjugate a verb beneath a tree. They would be interrupted by rain, or some acquaintance passing by. He was always satisfied with his pupil, however, and even said that the "young man" had a good memory.<br><br>Charles's mother was determined that he should not stop there. Ashamed, or rather weary, his father gave in without further resistance. They waited another year, until the boy had made his First Communion.<br><br>Six more months went by; then, the following year, Charles was finally sent to the lyc�e in Rouen. His father took him there himself toward the end of October, during the Saint-Romain fair.<br><br>It would now be hard for any of us to remember very much about him. He was a boy of moderate temperament; he played during recess, worked in study hall, listened in class, slept well in the dormitory and ate heartily in the dining hall. His temporary guardian was a wholesale hardware dealer on the Rue Ganterie who called for him once a month, on a Sunday, after his shop was closed, and sent him off to take a walk along the waterfront to look at the boats, then brought him back to school at seven o'clock, before supper. Every Thursday evening he wrote a long letter to his mother, using red ink and three sealing wafers; then he would go over his history notebooks or read an old volume of Anacharsis that lay around in the study hall. During class outings he talked with the servant, a countryman like himself.<br><br>By working hard he always managed to keep himself somewhere near the middle of the class; once he even earned an honorable mention in natural history. But when he had finished the tenth grade his parents took him out of the lyc�e and put him in medical school, confident that he would be able to get his baccalaureate degree by his own efforts.<br><br>His mother rented a room for him in the house of a dyer with whom she was acquainted. It was on the fifth floor, overlooking the brook known as the Eau-de-Robec. She made arrangements for his board, got him a table and two chairs and sent home for an old cherrywood bed. She also bought a small cast-iron stove and a supply of firewood so that her poor boy could keep himself warm. Then she left at the end of the week, after urging him countless times to behave himself now that he was going to be on his own.<br><br>He was staggered by the list of courses he read on the bulletin board: anatomy, pathology, physiology, pharmacy, chemistry, botany, clinical practice and therapeutics, not to mention hygiene and materia medica; to him these were all words of unknown etymology, and they were like so many doors leading into sanctuaries full of solemn shadows.<br><br>The lectures were equally baffling; he listened attentively but understood nothing. He worked hard just the same. He took notes, went to all his classes and never missed a single visit to the hospital. He performed his daily tasks like a mill horse walking blindfolded in a circle, ignorant of what he is grinding.<br><br>To save him money, his mother sent him a veal roast by the stagecoach each week. He had some of it for lunch every day when he came in from the hospital, kicking the mud off his shoes as he ate. Then he would hurry off again, walking all over town to go to lectures, the amphitheater or another hospital, and finally walking home at the end of the day. In the evening, after the meager dinner his landlord served him, he climbed back up to his room and went to work again, his damp clothes steaming as he sat in front of the red-hot stove.<br><br>On clear summer evenings, at the hour when the warm streets are deserted and servant girls are playing battledore and shuttlecock in front of the houses, he would open his window and look out, leaning on his elbows. The brook, which makes this part of Rouen a ki...</p><h2>Transnational Management: Text, Cases &amp; Readings in Cross-Border Management</h2><p><b><i>Transnational Management</i></b> focuses on the management challenges associated with developing strategies and managing the operations of companies whose activities stretch across national boundaries.

Its conceptual foundations, however, are replete with-paradoxes, and the implications of the theory for the nature of reality are profound. Interest in this topic has been re-awakened by a key experiment performed in 1982 to test the foundations of the theory. The occasion prompted BBC Radio to make a documentary (of the same title as the book) on the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics, for Radio 3. This book is based on the original transcripts of this broadcast, including interviews with several physicists who have played a prominent part in the debate on these paradoxes. The book also contains an introduction to quantum physics, its puzzles and paradoxes, and the contending proposed resolutions thereof, written at a non-specialist level. There is also a glossary and a bibliography.</p><p>Nine distinguished physicists consider the conceptual foundations of quantum physics--its paradoxes as well as its profound implications for the theory of nature--within a text based on a BBC radio documentary broadcast.Anybody who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it. Niel&#39;s Bohr&#39;s dictum bears witness to the bewildering impact of quantum theory, flying in the face of classical physics and dramatically transforming scientists&#39; outlook on our relationship with the material world. While the theory has been supremely successful in its explanation of some of the major problems in twentieth-century physics, its meaning is nevertheless the subject of unprecedented controversy amongst scientists.</p><h2>Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis (with JMP Printed Access Card)</h2><p>INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS introduces you to the study of statistics and data analysis by using real data and attention-grabbing examples.

With new concepts to understand and a large amount of mathematics to master, it is no wonder that students can sometimes find it overwhelming. <br><br><em>Elements of Physical Chemistry</em> has been carefully developed to help the reader increase their confidence when using physics and mathematics to answer fundamental questions about the structure of molecules, how chemical reactions take place, and why materials behave the way they do. <br><br>The content is tightly focussed and well-matched to undergraduate courses, making it easy to find the information needed. Topics are covered in a clear, easy-to-follow style, using everyday examples to help students to visualise things that can otherwise seem very abstract. <br><br>This edition sees further development of the learning features. These include Chemist's toolkits, which provide a reminder of mathematical techniques or introductory chemistry needed to follow material in the chapters; Worked examples, providing a step-by-step route through a problem; Brief illustrations which explain how to use equations; and Self-tests, allowing students to check their understanding.<br><br>On the accompanying Online Resource Centre, students have access to multiple choice questions and Webcasts; short videos showing, step-by-step, how to solve an exercise. For lecturers, there is a test bank and the figures from the text are available to download.</p><p><br>Peter Atkins is a fellow of Lincoln College in the University of Oxford and the author of about seventy books for students and a general audience.

It is well worth the time spent reading and discussing with colleagues because the ideas it holds are basic to rethinking and transforming vocabulary teaching.</em> <strong>-Karen Bromley</strong> Binghamton University, SUNY <br> How do you teach students the words that are crucial to unlocking the concepts in your content area? Until now "assign, define, test" has been the default strategy. But with <em>Word Wise and Content Rich</em>, Douglas Fisher and Nancy Frey bring vocabulary in out of the cold and into the heart of daily classroom practice in English, math, science, and history. <em>Word Wise and Content Rich</em> offers a five-part framework for teaching vocabulary that's tailored to the needs of adolescent learners yet mindful of the demands on content-area teachers. Grounded in current research, this framework gives students the multiple encounters necessary to lock in the meaning of new words forever. Fisher and Frey's five-step modelshows you how to: <ul> <li><strong>Make it intentional</strong>: select words for instruction and use word lists and up-to-date website lists wisely </li> <li><strong>Make it transparent</strong>: model word-solving and word-learning strategies for students </li> <li><strong>Make it useable</strong>: offer learners the collaborative work and oral practice essential to understanding concepts </li> <li><strong>Make it personal</strong>: give and monitor independent practice so students own words </li> <li><strong>Make it a priority</strong>: create a schoolwide program for word learning. </li> </ul> Use <em>Word Wise and Content Rich</em>, and close the word gap between low-achieving and high-achieving students. With its strategies, every student in your class-in your school-can access the textbook and develop the vocabulary needed for success in content-area reading. Read <em>Word Wise and Content Rich </em>and get the last word on great vocabulary teaching.</p><p><p>Douglas Fisher's latest book with Heinemann is Background Knowledge, coauthored with Nancy Frey.

The LEARNING WITH COMPUTERS series for middle school students delivers a strong foundation in keyboarding and computer applications. In this new project based text, students are introduced to the Explorers Club where three young members of the club - Luis, Ray, and Julie - guide students on virtual explorations. Along the way, each student keeps a personal journal about their explorations. The text offers multiple opportunities to reinforce and maintain basic keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, database, graphics, and Internet skills. Students are also introduced to new grade-level appropriate computer skills based on the National Educational Technology Standards (NETS). Additionally, the text emphasizes research, reading, and writing activities relevant to social studies, science, math, and language arts curriculum. The text for use with Windows applications, is divided into 4 units; Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Presentations (Graphics, Multimedia, and Integration) and Databases. Each unit contains multiple projects for a total of 18 projects per text, plus an introductory project. Each project focuses on a group of grade-level appropriate objectives for particular computer applications. Several hands-on activities within each project are designed around these objectives. Additionally, students use multiple application tools such as keyboard shortcuts, shortcut menus, toolbars, and the menu bar to perform tasks. This one-semester text can be used as a stand alone or in conjunction with South-Western&#39;s MicroType keyboarding software.

This book covers the history of our study of the cosmos from prehistory to a survey of modern astronomy and astrophysics. It does not attempt to cover everything, but deliberately concentrates on the important themes and topics, including stellar astronomy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--the source of many important concepts in modern astronomy--and the Copernican revolution, which led to the challenge of ancient authorities in many areas other than astronomy. This is an essential text for students of the history of science and for students of astronomy who require a historical background to their studies.</p><p>Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences, and one which has repeatedly led to fundamental changes in our view of the world and the sciences.

Part of a famous generation of women philosophers that includes Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Mary Warnock and Iris Murdoch, Midgley tells us in vivid and humorous fashion how they cut a swathe through the arid landscape of 1950s British Philosophy, writing and arguing about the grand themes of character, beauty and the meaning of rudeness. </p> <p></p> <p>The mother of three children, her journey is one of a woman who during the 1950s and 1960s was fighting to combine a professional career with raising a family.

In this vividly written biography, William E. Wallace offers a substantially new view of the artist. Not only a supremely gifted sculptor, painter, architect, and poet, Michelangelo was also an aristocrat who firmly believed in the ancient and noble origins of his family. The belief in his patrician status fueled his lifelong ambition to improve his family's financial situation and to raise the social standing of artists. Michelangelo's ambitions are evident in his writing, dress, and comportment, as well as in his ability to befriend, influence, and occasionally say "no" to popes, kings, and princes. Written from the words of Michelangelo and his contemporaries, this biography not only tells his own stories but also brings to life the culture and society of Renaissance Florence and Rome. Not since Irving Stone's novel The Agony and the Ecstasy has there been such a compelling and human portrayal of this remarkable yet credible human individual. <br><br> Subscribe to William Wallace's podcast on individual works of the master!

No less remarkable is the story of the collection, dispersal, and then frantic re-acquisition in the twentieth century of the world's greatest Assyrian collection ever to be in private hands. In this fascinating history of the reception of ancient Assyrian art in England and subsequently in America, John Malcolm Russell recounts the story of the huge collection of artifacts that Layard brought back to England. Much went to the British Museum, but much also to the fascinating Lady Charlotte Guest and then, via a Manhattan dealer and numerous competitive curators and millionaires, to the Metropolitan Museum. The last of Layard's Assyrian sculptures, discovered by the author in a private British school, was sold for $12 million at auction in 1994&#x2015;a figure that tripled the highest price ever paid for a work of antiquity.<br><br>This book is based almost entirely on unpublished archives, including the 10,000-page diary of Lady Charlotte Guest, the brilliant and resourceful cousin of Layard's and the richest woman in England. At her country house, Canford Manor, Guest commissioned from Barry, architect of the Houses of Parliament, the "Nineveh Porch" to display the remarkable sculptures. This established a whole new decorative and architectural fashion for "Assyrian Revival." Russell explores the events that led to the creation of the Porch, casting vivid new light on the archaeological, cultural, and architectural politics of the day.<br><br>The dispersal of the collection after World War I, and the initial reluctance of any American museum to acquire the sculptures, form another story&#x2015;entertainingly illuminated by the ingenious and ultimately successful scheme of the dealer Kelekian to sell them to John D. Rockefeller and others. Assyria's admission to the family of world art, and ethical questions surrounding the appropriation of antiquities, add another strand to the tale, culminating in Saddam Hussein's attempted intervention at the Christie's sale in 1994. With previously unpublished photographs, illustrations from rare nineteenth-century sources, and extensive passages from Guest's diary, this book provides an unprecedented look into the rich history and meaning of Assyrian art and of nineteenth- and twentieth-century taste, dealing, and collecting.<br></p><p>Indiana Jones, move over. In John Malcolm Russell, you have met your match. All right, so Russell doesn't roam the world with a bullwhip in his hand; nevertheless, the adventures outlined in <i>From Nineveh to New York</i> are the very stuff of fiction--except that they're all true. <p>Start with one forgotten city from ancient times, Nineveh, and the swashbuckling 19th-century archaeologist, Sir Austen Henry Layard, who discovered its ruins. Add a pinch of passion in the form of Layard's patroness and close friend, Lady Charlotte Guest, and her jealous husband, Sir John, and voila! A perfect romance. Now jump ahead a century and see what happens when modern archaeologist John Malcolm Russell, himself an expert on Assyrian artifacts, discovers a forgotten relief where nobody expected to find one, and you have the added bonus of a thriller. From the deserts of present-day Iraq to Lady Charlotte's country estate, then to America and finally to the hallowed halls of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Russell follows a particular set of stone reliefs, explaining as he goes the shifts in aesthetics, in art dealing, and in museums that have influenced their fate. </p><p> <i>From Nineveh to New York</i> is a history of Nineveh, of British and American artistic tastes, and of archaeology, all rolled into one entertaining package.</p>The story of Sir Austen Henry Layard&#39;s rediscovery of ancient Assyria and its fabled capital, Nineveh, is one of the great tales of nineteenth-century archeological imperialism, genius, and romance.

Mines have long lives, companies have little control over the prices at which they sell, prices are volatile, and the environmental impacts of mining are often not well managed. Despite this, the mining industry has received relatively little attention from neither economists nor the wider business community. There is a need to address the unique management challenges raised by this globally important industry. <br><i>Modern Management in the Global Mining Industry </i>addresses the economics of mining industries and the management of global mining companies in a manner which is both practical and guided by economic and management theory. Leading with the assertion that mining generates substantial benefits for all its stakeholders provided it is well-managed, and that this includes management of environmental impacts, the book argues that mining companies should move to seeing environmental preservation and sustenance of local communities as an objective rather than a constraint. <br>The book will be an important reference for practitioners working in mining and related industries and to researchers of economic and management theory, mining operations, mining engineering and commodities.</p><p><b>Robin Adams</b> spent most of his adult life working as a minerals economist with Citibank, his own company Resource Strategies and the CRU Group both in England and the United States.

These questions probe some of the deepest and most enduring problems that every society confronts, regardless of time and place.

Her qualitative analysis of Mexican American women in higher education reveals the processes by which they negotiate ethnic, gender, and class identities with Mexican immigrant parents and with their university communities. She provides significant insight into the processes of cultural continuity and change.

She is the author of <i>Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings</i>. Her research includes Chicano/a studies, race, class and gender, and qualitative research methods.After the 1965 Immigration Act eased restrictions on immigration, and as the children of post-1965 immigrants are coming of age, research on the 'new second generation' is gaining increasing momentum. Alma Garcia's exciting exegesis, <i>Narratives of Mexican American Women: Emergent Identities of the Second Generation,</i> is an important addition to this growing literature. Through the voices of women college students, Garcia examines the emergence and development of ethnic identity among second-generation Mexican American women. Bridging social constructionist and postmodernist frameworks, Garcia shows how these women construct and negotiate ethnic boundaries, identities, and cultures between and within the spaces of their immigrant homes, the educational environments, and the larger society.

He suggests a way to use interpretive methods in the everyday practice of psychotherapy. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p><b>Philip Cushman, Ph.D.,</b> is associate professor at the California School of Professional Psychology, is also in private practice in Oakland, California.Taking complementary approaches, these two authors examine the interrelationship of psychology and American culture and come to different conclusions to explain psychology's preeminent role in American life today. A psychotherapist and a teacher at the California School of Professional Psychology and at Saybrook Institute, Cushman shows how psychotherapy developed here and how it influenced the way Americans view themselves. Herman (social studies, Harvard) accounts for the unacknowledged role of behavioral scientists in shaping political and social policy in the United States over the last 50 years. In a series of related studies, covering such diverse areas as minstrel shows, mesmerism, psychoanalysis, comic strips, and advertising campaigns, Cushman examines the evolving concept of the individual in the United States and Western European society. Demonstrating that each era defines its concept of the self, Cushman contends that psychotherapy supports the individualism characteristic of 20th-century Americans: an "empty self," alienated from society and preoccupied with fulfillment through consumption. Herman surveys the role of behavioral science in shaping U.S. public and foreign policy beyond World War II. Academics and clinicians, mobilized to assist the war effort, conducted research on human behavior. After the war, these experts continued their research, advising politicians on matters relating to domestic and foreign policy including Project Camelot, race relations, the Kerner Commission on urban riots, and democratic movements in foreign countries. Clinical psychologists guided the transition from military to civilian life, shifting psychology's focus in the public mind from treatment of mental illness to promotion of mental health. Both books are recommended for academic and large public libraries where there is a focus on the history of ideas, psychology, and American culture.?Lucille Boone, San Jose P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Antonia : The Troll Garden : Selected Short Stories</h2><p>An outstanding collection of Cather&#39;s most popular short writings accompany the classic novel My Antonia in this handsome volume.528 pp. 6 X 9.

He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present day Pamukkale, Turkey), and lived in Rome until banishment when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece where he lived the rest of his life. His teachings were noted down and published by his pupil Arrian in his Discourses. Philosophy, Epictetus taught, is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are determined by fate, and are thus beyond our control, but we can accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. Individuals, however, are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. Suffering arises from trying to control what is uncontrollable, or from neglecting what is within our power. As part of the universal city that is the universe, human beings have a duty to care for all fellow humans. The person who follows these precepts will achieve happiness and peace of mind.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Organizational Communication: Foundations, Challenges, and Misunderstandings, Books a la Carte (4th Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Speech and Organizational Communication</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Communication as the key to effective organizational functioning</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Organizational Communication: Foundations, Challenges, and Misunderstandings</i> </b>explores organizational communication from the perspective of <i>all</i> organizational members &#x2014; not just management &#x2014; utilizing interviews to evaluate communication and misunderstandings.<b>&nbsp;</b>Modaff, Butler, and DeWine center their perspective on the concept of <i>misunderstandings</i>, which highlights the idea that communication in organizations is inherently problematic.

The author of Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution, Age of the Democratic Revolution, The World of the French Revolution, and The Improvement of Humanity: Education and the French Revolution, Palmer has also translated such books as Georges Lefebvre's, Coming of the French Revolution, Louis Bergeron's, France Under Napoleon, and Jean-Paul Bertaud's, Army of the French Revolution and has served as editor and translator of From Jacobin to Liberal: Marc-Antoine Jullian, 1775-1848. He served as President of the American Historical Association in 1970 and has been the recipient of the Bancroft Prize, 1960 and The Antonio Feltrinelli International Prize for History in Rome, 1990.<br><br>A specialist in modern and contemporary European history, Joel Colton taught at Duke University from 1947 to 1989 and chaired the History Department from 1967 to 1974. He is the author of books and articles in French history and became known to generations of students and teachers as co-author with the late Robert R. Palmer of the widely read college textbook A History of the Modern World, of which the tenth edition was published in 2007. At Duke he served for several years on the executive committee and as chair of the university's elected faculty body, the Academic Council. On extended leave from Duke, he was Director for Humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York from 1974 to 1982, administering a domestic and international program in support of research and teaching in the humanities. After retiring at Duke in 1989, he continued his research and writing, participating in conferences at home and abroad, and serving as lecturer for alumni travel groups in Europe and Asia. Born August 23, 1918, and educated in New York City, to which he remained a frequent visitor, he graduated from Townsend Harris High School in 1933 and 1937 received his B.A. degree from the City College of New York, magna cum laude, with election to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year and with honors in French and medals in Latin and French. Graduating in the Depression years, he began graduate work in history at Columbia University on a part-time basis while working full time as an assistant in the Registrar's office at the City College. He earned an M.A. degree at Columbia in 1940. Preparing himself also for high school teaching at a time when college teaching positions were scarce, he took a master's degree in education at the City College and taught at the Bronx High School of Science in New York as a teacher in training in 1941-42. Military service in the Second World War interrupted his graduate studies. Serving in the U.S. Armny from August 1942 to June 1946, he was commissioned in 1944 and served overseas as a military intelligence officer in Europe for eighteen months, in combat and in the occupation of Germany. In articles he wrote in 1955 and published in Army History and the Duke Alumni Magazine commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe he described some of his wartime experiences, including his crossing of the Rhine at the Remagen Bridge in March 1945. After the war he resumed his graduate work, began teaching at Duke in 1947, and received his Ph.D. degree from Columbia in 1950. His first historical publication, Compulsory Labor Arbitration in France, 1936-1939 (Columbia UP, 1951), an outgrowth of his dissertation, received favorable reviews in this country and in Europe. Close to a half century later, in 1999, Osaka University in Japan published a Japanese translation of the monograph in a series described as "notable books on France and Spain in the 1930s." His second book, more broadly focused on the 1930s, was L�on Blum: Humanist in Politics, published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1966, with a French translation following in 1968 published by Fayard, and a second edition and new forward published by Duke University Press in 1987. Alfred Knopf, who took a special interest in the book, reprinted in the then Knopf house organ, teh Borzoi Quarterly, the blooper in the British magazine Encounter that read: "The modern novel has been in a serious crisis ever since James Joyce's monumental effort to narrate a day in the life of Leon Blum." L�on Blum was, of course, not James Joyce's Leopold Bloom but the gifted French intellectual and literary figure in the years before 1914 who came to head the French Socialist party after the First World War. He was France's first Socialist, and first Jewish, premier, heading the Popular Front government in the tumultuous 1930s.

He documents and analyzes how, from the early 19th century through the present, the combined endeavors of schools, advertising, and media have led to the creation of a consumerist ideology and ensured its central place in American life and global culture.<br> <br> Spring first defines <i>consumerist ideology</i> and <i>consumer-citizen</i> and explores their 19th-century origins in schools, children's literature, the commercialization of American cities, advertising, newspapers, and the development of department stores. He then traces the rise of consumerist ideology in the 20th century by looking closely at: the impact of the home economics profession on the education of women as consumers and the development of an American cuisine based on packaged and processed foods; the influence of advertising images of sports heroes, cowboys, and the clean-shaven businessman in shaping male identity; the outcomes of the growth of the high school as a mass institution on the development of teenage consumer markets; the consequences of commercial radio and television joining with the schools to educate a consumer-oriented population so that, by the 1950s, consumerist images were tied to the Cold War and presented as the "American way of life" in both media and schools; the effects of the civil rights movement on integrating previously excluded groups into the consumer society; the changes the women's movement demanded in textbooks, school curricula, media, and advertising that led to a new image of women in the consumer market; and the ascent of fast food education. Spring carries the story into the 21st century by examining the evolving marriage of schools, advertising, and media and its ongoing role in educating the consumer-citizen and creating an integrated consumer market.<br> <br> This book will be of wide interest to scholars, professionals, and students across foundations of education, history and sociology of education, educational policy, mass communications, American history, and cultural studies.

Think about a recent movie and there will be some sort of special effects such as explosions or virtual worlds. Cloth simulation is no different and is ubiquitous because most virtual characters (hopefully!) wear some sort of clothing.</p><p>The focus of this book is physics-based cloth simulation. We start by providing background information and discuss a range of applications. This book provides explanations of multiple cloth simulation techniques. More specifically, we start with the most simple explicitly integrated mass-spring model and gradually work our way up to more complex and commonly used implicitly integrated continuum techniques in state-of-the-art implementations. We give an intuitive explanation of the techniques and give additional information on how to efficiently implement them on a computer.</p><p>This book discusses explicit and implicit integration schemes for cloth simulation modeled with mass-spring systems. In addition to this simple model, we explain the more advanced continuum-inspired cloth model introduced in the seminal work of Baraff and Witkin [1998]. This method is commonly used in industry.</p><p>We also explain recent work by Liu et al. [2013] that provides a technique to obtain fast simulations. In addition to these simulation approaches, we discuss how cloth simulations can be art directed for stylized animations based on the work of Wojtan et al. [2006]. Controllability is an essential component of a feature animation film production pipeline. We conclude by pointing the reader to more advanced techniques.</p></p><p><p>Tuur Stuyck started working with computer graphics as early as 2006.

The ability to work effectively with people is as important for the conservation professional as it is for the police officer, the school teacher, or the lawyer. Yet skills for managing human interactions are rarely taught in academic science programs, leaving many conservation professionals woefully unprepared for the daily realities of their jobs.&nbsp;Written in an entertaining, easy-to-read style, <i>The Conservation Professional&#x2019;s Guide to Working with People</i> fills a gap in conservation education by offering a practical, how-to guide for working effectively with colleagues, funders, supervisors, and the public. The book explores how natural resource professionals can develop skills and increase their effectiveness using strategies and techniques grounded in social psychology, negotiation, influence, conflict resolution, time management, and a wide range of other fields. Examples from history and current events, as well as real-life scenarios that resource professionals are likely to face, provide context and demonstrate how to apply the skills described.&nbsp;<i>The Conservation Professional&#x2019;s Guide to Working with People</i> should be on the bookshelf of any environmental professional who wants to be more effective while at the same time reducing job-related stress and improving overall quality of life. Those who are already good at working with people will learn new tips, while those who are petrified by the thought of conducting public meetings, requesting funding, or working with constituents will find helpful, commonsense advice about how to get started and gain confidence.</p><p>Scott A.

Furthermore, the high-quality binding and reasonable price of the paperback edition make for a valuable, durable book that is economically accessible to students and professionals alike." (<i>Journal of Mammalogy</i>)<br><br>"I recommend the book to anyone who is short on time and looking for some new skills to bring to the table: it will make you more aware of your relationships with others and raise your skills&#x2014;personal and professional&#x2014; to a higher level." (<i>Ecological Restoration</i>)<br><br>"This book means you don't have to read a book on conflict resolution, another on managing personnel, and a third on time management. Bonar has nicely summarized these in a single, easy-to-read book that is relevant to the conservation field."

An essential reference for every serious reader of the Bible.<br><br>B &amp; W illustrations and line-art throughout.In the past 30 years , there have been three major encyclopedic Bible dictionaries published in English: The Interpreter's Bible Dictionary (IBD ), the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible , and The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ( ISBE ). When it was published in 1962 (with a supplementary volume in 1976), the IBD represented the state of critical Biblical scholarship. The ISBE , though an extensive revision of the previous edition (1929), retained many articles from its predecessors (1915 and 1929). Because of the numerous developments in biblical scholarship during the past three decades, the editor felt (rightly) that it was time for a Bible dictionary that would represent the current state of the discipline. The Anchor Bible Dictionary ( ABD ) is the result of his vision. The ABD is both international and interconfessional, with nearly 1000 contributors from around the world representing Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim traditions (and also those of no religious tradition). The list of contributing scholars includes names long associated with biblical and theological studies. The currency of the dictionary as a whole is reflected especially in the inclusion of such subjects as the Dead Sea Scrolls, early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, and sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism (including feminist hermeneutics), and in numerous entries on archaeological sites. In addition, the bibliographies are usually up to date and often extensive. Unlike previous Bible dictionaries, the bibliographic entries in the ABD are complete citations, listed individually rather than in a run-on fashion, and hence easier to use. Even in such a monumental success as the ABD , there are weak spots. One might expect to find pronunciations, especially for place and personal names--which is the case with the IBD and the ISBE --but none are given here. There are few illustrations throughout. The maps are inadequate, and some of the topics are handled clumsily. Yet overall, this is a solid piece of work, well written and well edited. It will serve scholars and students because of its currency and thoroughness and lay readers because of its generally readable style. The ABD deserves a place on the shelves beside the standard Bible dictionaries of previous generations and is recommended for public, academic, and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Craig W.

These two very different substances are intimately involved in life processes where, together, they play a key role in many critical functions. Central to this role is the ability of water to lift the basic salt particles from the solid into the liquid medium as illustrated on this cover. The Dead Sea in Israel, as shown on the front cover, represents a very rare phenomenon where the two can coexist. The water in the Dead Sea has so much dissolved salt that it can hold no more. As a result, spectacular pillars of salt crystals line the shores. The composition of water and salt and how they interact are among the fascinating subjects in the study of chemistry.</p><p><b>Leo J.

Professor Philip Bishop wrote this book because there was no concise handbook on the market covering the arts as a whole. His text provides a succinct and affordable guide to the arts and humanities geared to students who are starting from scratch in their study of the arts. Self-contained chapters provide an essential companion guide to understanding a specific discipline&#x2014;including painting, sculpture, music, and theater&#x2014;with a clear and insightful explanation of the discipline&#x2019;s process of creation.</p></p><p><p> This guide assists readers through their encounters with the best in human culture and creativity. Each chapter concisely introduces an art form through its historical or social importance, its essential vocabulary, and its important styles or artists. From there, each chapter leads readers through the unique experience of the art and ends with a companion guide which focuses on questions to ask, terms to remember and a reminder that readers should think and feel for themselves. </p> <p><b>In each chapter:</b></p> <ul> <li>The Tool Kit</li> <li>A glossary of everything the reader needs to know about a particular art form</li> <li>Style Guide</li> <li>Important styles or principal artists</li> <li>Step-by-step directions to guide the reader through the experience of an art</li> <li>A Companion to the Art</li> </ul><p> I remember beginning to play basketball at age eight, a game I still play twice a week, rickety knees and all. My dad handed me a basketball and told me to throw it as high as I could against the garage wall. He wanted to see if I could reach the ten-foot rim. I must have done okay, because he went right out to dig the post-holes in the backyard for a basketball goal. I played my best games on that goal in the Winter moonlight, dribbling on a frozen mud court. </p> <p> Think of this handbook as the garage wall and postholes for a different game�a lifelong enjoyment of the arts. It's easy for folks to think they don't measure up to high culture. They're intimidated by the orchestra in white tie and tails, or the hallowed silence of a museum. They're puzzled by the painting they see on the walls or by the drama where nothing seemed to happen. And opera�isn't that fat ladies singing? </p> <p> If it's confidence you lack, this handbook offers a gentle push through the door of that museum, theater, or concert hall. Once your fanny's in a seat at the Met or you're wandering the Louvre, this guide will deepen your experience of the moment. It teaches you to observe and enjoy, to think and feel in response to the arts. And afterwards at the bar or coffee-shop, or reading the museum guide or a newspaper review a day later, you'll find you speak the critical language of the arts. You'll know you're in the game when you find yourself in conversation with friends and family, and someone asks how you know all that. </p> <p> Maybe I'm the person to give you courage because I started where many of you do�as a beginner. I was reared in a small-town family that hardly ever ventured to the big city for culture. The first real play I remember was my sister's high school musical. I wandered through some museums in college, but as a literature major, I didn't pay much attention. I could tell you the plots of dozens of novels, but just one painting sticks in my memory�Goya's <i>Saturn Devouring His Children.</i> As a college student loose in Madrid, I wandered through a door at the Prado, turned, and Saturn stopped me cold. </p> <p> Now I teach and write professionally about the visual arts (I'm art critic for a medium-sized city newspaper) as someone who's mostly self-taught. What I know about the visual and performing arts comes from reading books, magazines, and newspapers, and listening to smart people, and then constantly seeking out new experiences in the world of high culture. I have learned to understand and love the arts through a lifelong, incremental layering of knowledge and experience. </p> <p> As a teacher by vocation, I think that's the best way to learn. Being smart about art (and about other things, too) doesn't require a sophisticate's birthright or a minimum intelligence score or even a college degree. Art smarts come to an open mind that's willing to reach out, take a risk, and encounter new experience. I'm hoping that mind is yours. </p> <p><b>WHAT'S IN THIS BOOK</b></p> <p> Nine of the chapters that follow are each devoted to an art as you'll encounter it out there in the real world of museums, galleries, concert halls, theaters�all the places and spaces of culture where it actually exists. In each chapter, you'll find some or all of these elements. </p> <p><b>REAL ENCOUNTER</b></p> <p> Recollections and reflections are from my own encounters with works of art in this medium. Some are drawn from my own journal entries, written in the shelf-full of spiral notebooks. Some are based on my collection of performance programs, newspaper articles and reviews, and postcards�all the stuff I keep as a physical memory of the encounter. I often do the same thing with great meals at friends' homes or restaurants as a way of recalling the pleasure of the moment. It's a mental snapshot of the encounter. </p> <p><b>TOOL KIT</b></p> <p> A glossary of essential terms provides definitions of everything you need to know about this art. </p> <p><b>STYLE GUIDE</b></p> <p> A short list of important styles or principal artists. </p> <p><b>THE EXPERIENCE</b></p> <p> Step-by-step directions guide you through the experience of an art. The kind of things that anybody who's played the game for a while knows to do. Beginners need instructions. </p> <p><b>A COMPANION TO THE ART</b></p> <p> Pages you can photocopy and take with you that provide questions to ask, terms to remember, and a reminder to forget about that dumb handbook. Think and feel for yourself! </p> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></p> <p> I wish to thank Richard Rietveld, Suzanne Salapa, Mary Jo Pecht, and Ralph Clemente for their support.

Ever since I was a child, I&#39;ve been frightened: the look of men, yoking up the oxen, picking up sacks of wheat, calling to each other, their thick voices, their thick boots.

This innovative textbook offers a new approach to understanding different economic systems that reflects both recent transformations in the world economy and recent changes in the field.This new edition examines a wide variety of institutional and systemic arrangements, many of which reflect deep roots in countries' cultures and histories. </p><p>The book has been updated and revised throughout, with new material in both the historical overview and the country case studies. It offers a broad survey of economic systems, then looks separately at market capitalism, Marxism and socialism, and &#x201c;new traditional economies&#x201d; (with an emphasis on the role of religions, Islam in particular, in economic systems). It presents case studies of advanced capitalist nations, including the United States, Japan, Sweden, and Germany; alternative paths in the transition from socialist to market economies taken by such countries as Russia, the former Soviet republics, Poland, China, and the two Koreas; and developing countries, including India, Iran, South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil. The new chapters on Brazil and South Africa complete the book's coverage of all five BRICS nations; the chapter on South Africa extends the book's comparative treatment to another continent. The chapter on Brazil with its account of the role of the Amazon rain forest as a great carbon sink expands the coverage of global environmental and sustainability issues. Each chapter ends with discussion questions.</p></p><p>J.

Now in its third edition, it continues to adapt and adjust as the world is transforming, and yet retains the enduring lessons for those who want to engage in the comparative systems analysis. Much has happened since 1989, let alone since 1917, and Rosser and Rosser's text guides us through the bewildering and amazing world of the theory and practice of capitalism, socialism, and other -isms as well as the real-existing political, economic, and social experiences in the countries West, East, North, and South. Just a brilliant text full of insight and wisdom from all we have learned over time and across countries.</p>&#x2015;<b>Peter Boettke</b>, University Professor of Economics &amp; Philosophy, George Mason University<br><br><p>This book provides an incredibly broad and innovative comparative systems view of market economic systems, socialist systems, and Islamic and other economies based on religious principles. Rosser and Rosser show how history shapes fundamental institutions that allocate resources, protect property rights and enforce contracts. And they employ modern economic theory to explain how those diverse economic institutions deal with economic problems and can productively evolve or fail to move forward.

Alice quickly finds out that nothing is as it seems in the wild world of Wonderland...</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Prominent progressive writer, speaker, and minister Robin Meyers proposes that the best way to recapture the spirit of the early Christian church is to recognize that Jesus-following was and must be again <i>subversive</i> in the best sense of the word because the gospel taken seriously turns the world upside down.</p> <p>No matter how the church may organize itself or worship, the defining characteristic of church of the future will be its Jesus-inspired countercultural witness.</p> <ul> <li>Debunks commonly held beliefs about the early church and offers a vision for the future rooted in the past</li> <li>Proposes that the church of the future must leave doctrinal tribalism behind and seek a unity of mission instead</li> <li>Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu said,"Robin Meyers has spoken truth to power, and the church he loves will never be the same."</li> </ul></p><p>"Dear reader, I hope that you do not find the word crazy to be offensive when used to describe Jesus of Nazareth.

Written by the prominent minister, teacher, speaker, and writer, Robin Meyers, The Underground Church posits that the best way to recapture the spirit of The Way is to recognize that Jesus-following was&#x2014;and must be again&#x2014;subversive in the best sense of the word. Instead of endless theological and political arguments, the church must be more concerned with being loving than with being right.</p> <p>Meyers offers a potent antidote for organized-religion-as-usual&#x2014;suggesting that until being a follower of Jesus is dangerous again we will continue to bless the status quo instead of transforming it. We must return to our culturally and socially subversive roots and live by the two most powerful words in the gospel "Fear not." No matter how the church may organize itself or worship, the defining characteristic of the Beloved Community should be its love of justice and its countercultural compassion for all people.</p> <p>It is time to stop arguing about who is saved and who is lost, who is the elect and who is the damned, who is chosen and who is "Left Behind." Are we in it for ourselves or for others? Are we willing to be transformed by God, or will we continue to play god? Is going to church about looking decent or about being undone by a radical gospel? Can we do mission work across our differences, or will our differences define us?</p> <p><i>The Underground Church</i> will provide healthy, inclusive, dignified options for living in a world saturated with sickness, separation, and indignity. In short, we will not try to get people up into heaven.

The insights Cohen provides into subculture and mass morality are as relevant today as they were when the book was originally published in 1972, as illustrated by the author's introduction for this new edition, in which he tracks moral panics over the last thirty years, commenting on the demonization of young offenders and asylum seekers and on the <em>News of the World</em>'s 'name and shame' campaign against paedophiles.<br>Revisiting the theory of moral panic and exploring the way in which the concept has been used, this new edition features a select bibliography of key texts for further reading. The third edition of <em>Folk Devils and Moral Panics</em> makes available a valuable and widely recommended text.</p><p>Stanely Cohen is a Professor at the London School of Economics. He was professor of Criminology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. His books include Escape Attempts: The Theory and Practice of Resistance to Everyday Life (with Laurie Taylor, 1976) and Against Criminology, (1988).Stan Cohen&#39;s `Folk Devils and Moral Panics&#39; was a brilliant and subtle exercise in grounded theory. It has proved consistently fertile for a great deal of new work in sociological analysis the thirty years since its first publication and its critical idea of moral panics proved to be generative for a wide variety of scholars and research fields. In the new introduction to the third edition, an original piece of reflection on the vicarious pathways of its appropriation, and a wonderful reprise of its uses and abuses, Stan Cohen gently but steadily guides us back to its original illuminating intellectual core.

It provides in-depth commentary on educational history, philosophy, and governance, while giving special attention to current critical topics such as the changing federal role in educational finance.</p><p>David Miller Sadker is currently Professor of Education and Director of the Master of Arts in Teaching Program at American University. With his wife, Myra, who passed away in 1995, he coauthored five books, including Teachers, Schools, and Society (McGraw-Hill) and Failing at Fairness: How Our Schools Cheat Girls (Touchstone Press, 1995). More than fifty of their articles have appeared in Phi Delta Kappan, Harvard Educational Review, Educational Leadership, and other professional journals. Their research and writing efforts received distinguished achievement awards from the American Educational Research Association, The American Association of University Women, the Educational Press Association, the American University, Harvard University, and the University of Massachusetts. Dr. Sadker&#39;s research interests have focused on foundations of education, educational equity, teacher preparation, and curriculum. He has codirected numerous grants funded by the U.S. Department of Education. He has conducted teaching and equity workshops for principals, teachers, and professors in over forty states and overseas. Myra Pollack Sadker (1943-1995) pioneered much of the research documenting gender bias in America&#39;s schools. She was Professor of Education and Dean of the School of Education at American University. She died while undergoing treatment for breast cancer in 1995. Through her writings and lectures, Myra Sadker alerted Americans to the academic, physical, psychological and career costs of sexism. She wrote the first book for teachers on the issue of sexism in 1973. Over twenty years later, in 1994, she coauthored the first popular book on this topic: Failing at Fairness: How America&#39;s Schools Cheat Girls. Between these two publications, Myra Sadker brought her cause for educational equity to a national audience. Along with her husband David, Myra Sadker spoke in more than forty states and overseas, giving hundreds of presentations and workshops for teachers and parents concerned with the negative impact of sexist behaviors. She wrote scores of articles on how to raise and teach children free from the debilitating impact of sexism. In her name, Myra Sadker Advocates was established to continue her efforts and create more equitable and effective schools.

How can we understand and use this distinction in the practical application of therapy?</strong></p> In their solution-oriented, competency-based approach to couples therapy, Phillip Ziegler and Tobey Hiller answer this question. In <em>Recreating Partnership</em>, an innovative, theoretically sound, and practical handbook for clinicians, Ziegler and Hiller present a bold and clinically useful concept, the good story/bad story dichotomy. The book shows clinicians how to use this narrative concept in conducting effective and efficient relationship therapy that will help couples build solutions collaboratively, invigorate partnership, and thrive, each in their own unique ways. The book covers issues such as establishing rapport with antagonistic partners; developing therapeutic goals; hosting conversations that reinvigorate the couple's good story; how, when, and whether to offer task assignments; addressing issues such as domestic violence; and how to bring therapy to a close, as well as many cogent and helpful transcripts. Written for psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, and anyone who works with couples, <em>Recreating Partnership</em> will be exciting and useful to both the novice and experienced practitioner.</p><p><p><strong>Phillip Ziegler</strong> and <strong>Tobey Hiller</strong>, who have been married to each other for 25 years, are MFTs with more than 40 combined years of clinical experience.

Stinkface, the young narrator, relates how on this particular night, Louis shows them something special. With him, they bound through the woods, stopping on a hillside above a small village. There, they observe colored lights, smell various scents, and hear singing, obvious evidence of a Christmas celebration. At the conclusion, while listening to the human voices, the wolves begin to sing (howl), too. Stinkface concludes, "We didn't see the humans, but we could hear them. They were singing. We listened. It was nice. I thought, Even if they were dangerous, they are animals, just like we are." The childlike felt-marker illustrations convey the playfulness and camaraderie of the wolves in their snowy nighttime habitat, but the text is unconvincing. The sudden anthropomorphizing of Stinkface's perspective, the sly but too tenuous connection with Christmas, and the vapid conclusion do not ring true.

After twenty years, he was the world&#39;s biggest movie star. In 2003, he was Governor of California and a household name around the world.</p><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, born in Thal, Austria in 1947, was Governer of California from 2003-2011. Before that, he had a long career starring in such films as the Terminator series, Stay Hungry, for which he won a Golden Globe,Twins, Predator, and Junior. His first book Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder was a bestseller when publisher in 1977 and has never been out of print since.

Total Recall is his first public reflection on his term as Governor during what was perhaps California&#39;s most tumultous decade.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br> <br><b>Out of Austria</b><br> <br>I WAS BORN INTO a year of famine. It was 1947, and Austria was occupied by the Allied armies that had defeated Hitler&#x2019;s Third Reich. In May, two months before I was born, there were hunger riots in Vienna, and in Styria, the southeastern province where we lived, the food shortages were just as bad. Years later, if my mother wanted to remind me about how much she and my father sacrificed to bring me up, she&#x2019;d tell me how she&#x2019;d foraged across the countryside, making her way from farm to farm to collect a little butter, some sugar, some grain. She&#x2019;d be away three days sometimes. <i>Hamstern,</i> they called it, like a hamster gathering nuts; scrounging for food was so common.<br> <br>Thal was the name of our very typical farm village. A few hundred families made up the entire population, their houses and farms clustered in hamlets connected by footpaths and lanes. The unpaved main road ran for a couple of kilometers up and down low alpine hills covered with fields and pine forests.<br> <br>We saw very little of the British forces who were in charge&#x2014;just an occasional truck with soldiers rolling through. But to the east, Russians occupied the area, and we were very conscious of them. The Cold War had begun, and we all lived in fear that the Russian tanks would roll in, and we&#x2019;d be swallowed up into the Soviet empire. The priests in church would scare the congregation with horror stories of Russians shooting babies in the arms of their mothers.<br> <br>Our house was on the top of a hill along the road, and as I was growing up, it was unusual to see more than one or two cars come through a day. A ruined castle dating back to feudal times was right across from us, one hundred yards from our door.<br> <br>On the next rise were the mayor&#x2019;s office; the Catholic church where my mother made us all go to Sunday Mass; the local <i>Gasthaus</i>, or inn, which was the social heart of the village; and the primary school attended by me and my brother, Meinhard, who was a year older than me.<br> <br>My earliest memories are of my mother washing clothes and my father shoveling coal. I was no more than three years old, but the image of my father is especially sharp in my mind. He was a big, athletic guy, and he did a lot of things himself. Every autumn we&#x2019;d get our winter supply of coal, a truckload dumped in front of our house, and on this occasion he was letting Meinhard and me help him carry it into the cellar. We were always so proud to be his assistants.<br> <br>My father and mom both originally came from working-class families farther north&#x2014;factory laborers, mostly, in the steel industry. During the chaos at the end of World War II, they&#x2019;d met in the city of M�rzzuschlag, where my mother, Aurelia Jadrny, was a clerk in a food-distribution center at city hall. She was in her early twenties, and a war widow&#x2014;her husband had gotten killed just eight months after their wedding. Working at her desk one morning, she noticed my father passing on the street&#x2014;an older guy, in his late thirties, but tall and good looking and wearing the uniform of the gendarmerie, the rural police. She was crazy about men in uniforms, so every day after that she watched for him. She figured out when his shift was so she would be sure to be at her desk. They&#x2019;d talk through the open window, and she&#x2019;d give him some food from whatever they had on hand.<br> <br>His name was Gustav Schwarzenegger. They got married late in 1945. He was thirty-eight, and she was twenty-three. My father was assigned to Thal and put in charge of a four-man post responsible for the village and nearby countryside. The salary was barely enough to live on, but with the job came a place to live: the old forester&#x2019;s lodge, or <i>Forsthaus</i>. The forest ranger, or <i>Forstmeister</i>, lived on the ground floor, and the <i>Inspektor</i> and his family occupied the top.<br> <br>My boyhood home was a very simple stone and brick building, well proportioned, with thick walls and little windows to keep out the alpine winters. We had two bedrooms, each with a coal oven for heat, and a kitchen, where we ate, did our homework, washed ourselves, and played games. The heat in that room was supplied by my mother&#x2019;s stove.<br> <br>There was no plumbing, no shower, and no flushing toilet, just a kind of chamber pot. The nearest well was almost a quarter mile away, and even when it was raining hard or snowing, one of us had to go. So we used as little water as we could. We&#x2019;d heat it and fill the washbasin and give ourselves sponge or cloth baths&#x2014;my mother would wash herself first with the clean water; next, my father would wash himself; and then Meinhard and I would have our turn. It didn&#x2019;t matter if we had slightly darker water as long as we could avoid a trip to the well.<br> <br>We had wood furniture, very basic, and a few electric lamps. My father liked pictures and antiques, but when we were growing up, these were luxuries he couldn&#x2019;t afford. Music and cats brought liveliness to our house. My mother played the zither and sang us songs and lullabies, but it was my father who was the real musician. He could play all the wind and reed instruments: trumpets, fl�gelhorns, saxophones, clarinets. He also wrote music and was the conductor of the region&#x2019;s gendarmerie band&#x2014;if a police officer died anywhere in the state, the band would play at the funeral. Often on Sundays in summer, we&#x2019;d go to concerts in the park, where he would conduct and sometimes play. Most of our relatives on his side were musical, but that talent never made it to Meinhard or me.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not sure why we had cats instead of dogs&#x2014;maybe because my mother loved them and they cost nothing because they caught their own food. But we always had lots of cats, running in and out, curling up here and there, bringing down half-dead mice from the attic to show off what great hunters they were. Everyone had his or her own cat to curl up with in bed at night&#x2014;that was our tradition. At one point, we had seven cats. We loved the cats, but never too much, because there was no such thing as going to the vet. If one of the cats started falling over from being too sick or too old, we&#x2019;d wait to hear the shot from the backyard&#x2014;the sound of my father&#x2019;s pistol. My mother, Meinhard, and I would then go out and make a grave with a little cross on top.<br> <br>My mother had a black cat named Mooki that she constantly claimed was unique, although none of us could see why. One day when I was about ten, I was arguing with my mother about not wanting to do my homework. Mooki was nearby, curled up on the couch, as usual. I must have said something really uppity because my mother moved to smack me across the face. I saw it coming and tried to fend her off, but instead I hit her with the back of my arm. In a second, Mooki was off the couch&#x2014;she leaped up between us and started clawing at my face. I pulled her off me and yelled, &#x201c;Ow! What is this!?&#x201d; Mom and I looked at each other and burst out laughing, even though I had blood running down my cheek. Finally, she had proof that Mooki was special.<br> <br>After the turmoil of the war, my parents&#x2019; big desire was for us to be stable and safe. My mother was a big, square-built woman, solid and resourceful, and she was also a traditional hausfrau who kept the house immaculately clean. She&#x2019;d roll up the rugs and get down on her hands and knees with a brush and soap and scrub the planking, and then dry it off with rags. She was fanatical about keeping our clothes neatly hung and our sheets and towels precisely folded, with razor-sharp corners at the edge. Out back, she planted beets and potatoes and berries to keep us fed, and in fall she would put up preserves and sauerkraut in thick glass jars for the winter. Always when my father came home from the police station at twelve thirty, mom would be ready with lunch, and again with supper when he came home precisely at six o&#x2019;clock.<br> <br>The finances were her job too. Having been a clerk, she was very organized and was good at writing and math. Each month when my father brought home his pay, she&#x2019;d leave him five hundred schillings for pocket money and take the rest for running the house. She handled all the family&#x2019;s correspondence and paid the monthly bills. Once a year, always in December, she took us shopping for clothes. We&#x2019;d ride a bus to the Kastner &amp; �hler department store just over the next ridge, in Graz. The old building had only two or three floors, but in our minds it was as big as the Mall of America. It had escalators and a metal and glass elevator, so we could see everything as we rode up and down. Mom would buy just the absolute necessities for us, shirts and underwear and socks and so forth, and these would be delivered to our house the next day in neat brown paper bundles. Installment plans were new then, and she really liked being able to pay off a fraction of the bill each month until it was all paid. Liberating people like my mom to shop was a good way to stimulate the economy.<br> <br>She took charge of medical problems too, even though my father was the one trained to deal with emergencies. My brother and I had every possible childhood illness, from mumps to scarlet fever to measles, so she got lots of practice. Nothing stopped her: one winter night when we were toddlers, Meinhard had pneumonia, and there was no doctor or ambulance to be had. Leaving me home with my dad, my mother bundled Meinhard on her back and hiked more than two miles in the snow to the hospital in Graz.<br> <br>My father was a lot more complicated. He could be generous and affectionate, especially with her. They loved each other intensely. You could see it in the way she brought him coffee and in the way he was always finding small gifts for her, and hugging her and patting her on the behind. They shared their affection with us: we always got to cuddle up with them in bed, especially if we were scared by thunder and lightning.<br> <br>But about once a week, usually on Friday night, my father would come home drunk. He&#x2019;d been out until two or three or four in the morning, drinking at his usual table at the <i>Gasthaus</i> with the locals, often including the priest, the school principal, and the mayor. We&#x2019;d wake up to hear him banging around in a rage and yelling at my mom. The anger never lasted, and the next day he&#x2019;d be sweet and nice and take us to lunch or give us gifts to make up. If we misbehaved, however, he would smack us or use his belt on us.<br> <br>To us, all this seemed totally normal: everybody&#x2019;s dad used physical punishment and came home drunk. One father who lived near us pulled his son&#x2019;s ears and chased him with a thin, flexible stick that he&#x2019;d soaked in water to make it hurt more. The drinking seemed like just a part of the camaraderie, which was usually much more benign. Sometimes the wives and families would be invited to join their husbands at the <i>Gasthaus</i>. We kids always felt honored to sit with the adults and then be treated to dessert. Or we&#x2019;d be allowed into the next room and drink a little Coca-Cola and play board games and look at magazines or the TV. We&#x2019;d be sitting there at midnight thinking, &#x201c;Wow, this is terrific!&#x201d;<br> <br>It took me years to understand that behind the <i>Gem�tlichkeit</i> there was bitterness and fear. We were growing up among men who felt like a bunch of losers. Their generation had started World War II and lost. During the war, my father had left the gendarmerie to become a policeman in the German army. He&#x2019;d served in Belgium and France, and in North Africa, where he caught malaria. In 1942 he barely escaped being captured at Leningrad, the bloodiest battle of the war. The building he was in was blown up by the Russians. He was trapped under rubble for three days. His back was broken, and he had shrapnel in both legs. It took months in a Polish hospital before he recovered enough to come home to Austria and rejoin the civilian police. And who knows how long it took his psychic wounds to heal, given all that he had witnessed? I heard them talk about it when they were drunk, and can imagine how painful it was for them. They were all beaten and also frightened that any day the Russians might come and take them away to rebuild Moscow or Stalingrad. They were angry. They tried to suppress the rage and humiliation, but disappointment was deep in their bones. Think about it: you are promised you will be a citizen of a great new empire. Every family will have the latest conveniences. Instead, you come home to a land in ruins, there&#x2019;s very little money, food is scarce, everything needs to be rebuilt. The occupying forces are there, so you&#x2019;re not even in charge of your country anymore. Worst of all, you have no way to process what you&#x2019;ve experienced. How could you cope with that unbelievable trauma when no one was supposed to talk about it?<br> <br>Instead, the Third Reich was being officially erased. All public servants&#x2014;local officials, schoolteachers, police&#x2014;had to go through what the Americans called denazification. You were questioned, and your record was examined to determine if you had been really hard-core or in a position to commit war crimes. Everything having to do with the Nazi era was confiscated: books, films, posters&#x2014;even your personal journals and photographs. You had to give over everything: the war was supposed to be erased from your mind.<br> <br>Meinhard and I were only faintly aware of it. In our house was a beautiful picture book that we would borrow to play priest and pretend it was the Bible because it was much larger than our actual family Bible. One of us would stand and hold it open while the other would say Mass. The book was actually a do-it-yourself album for promoting the mighty accomplishments of the Third Reich. There were sections for different categories, such as public works, tunnels and dams under construction, Hitler&#x2019;s rallies and speeches, great new ships, new monuments, great battles being fought in Poland. Each category had blank pages that were numbered, and whenever you went to the store and bought something or invested in a war bond, you would get a photo to match up with a number and paste into your book. When the collection was complete, you&#x2019;d win a prize. I loved the pages that showed magnificent train stations and powerful locomotives spouting steam, and I was mesmerized by the picture of two men riding a little open flat handcar on the track, pumping the lever up and down to move themselves along&#x2014;that seemed like adventure and freedom to me.<br> <br>Meinhard and I had no idea what we were looking at, but one day when we went to play priest, the album was gone. We searched everywhere. Finally, I asked my mother where the beautiful book had disappeared: after all, that was our Bible! All she would say was, &#x201c;We had to give it up.&#x201d; Later I would say to my father, &#x201c;Tell me about the war,&#x201d; or ask him questions about what he did or went through. His reply was always, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to talk about.&#x201d;<br> <br>His answer to life was discipline. We had a strict routine that nothing could change: we&#x2019;d get up at six, and it would be my job or Meinhard&#x2019;s to get milk from the farm next door. When we were a little older and starting to play sports, exercises were added to the chores, and we had to earn our breakfast by doing sit-ups. In the afternoon, we&#x2019;d finish our homework and chores, and my father would make us practice soccer no matter how bad the weather was. If we messed up on a play, we knew we&#x2019;d get yelled at.<br> <br>My father believed just as strongly in training our brains. After Mass on Sunday, he&#x2019;d take us on a family outing: visiting another village, maybe, or seeing a play, or watching him perform with the police band. Then in the evening we had to write a report on our activities, ten pages at least. He&#x2019;d hand back our papers with red ink scribbled all over them, and if we had spelled a word wrong,...</p><h2>Time for Bed</h2><p>Darkness is falling everywhere and little ones are getting sleepy, feeling cozy, and being tucked in.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, <i>Urusei Yatsura</i>, was serialized in <i>Weekly Shonen Sunday</i>. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right.

Yet the New Testament is also among the most widely controversial and least clearly understood books in history. In these lectures, Professor Ehrman develops a carefully reasoned understanding of the New Testament - and the individuals and communities who created its texts. His approach is that of a historian, and the course suspends belief or disbelief to understand how, when, why, and by whom the New Testament was written in light of historical research. He also reviews key texts omitted from the New Testament. Many people remain unaware of how the New Testament was written and transmitted. This course draws on modern biblical scholarship, recent archaeological discoveries, and careful literary analysis to trace the history of the New Testament and of the early Christian faith community. Professor Ehrman brings impressive scholarly evidence to bear on the task of reconstructing the life and ministry of Jesus and the origins of Christianity in the decades before and during the composition of the books that make up the New Testament.</p><p></p><h2>Britt-Marie Was Here: A Novel</h2><p>The bestselling author of A Man Called Ove and My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She&#x2019;s Sorry returns with an irresistible novel about finding love and second chances in the most unlikely of places.<br><br>Britt-Marie can&#x2019;t stand mess. A disorganized cutlery drawer ranks high on her list of unforgivable sins. She begins her day at 6 a.m., because only lunatics wake up later than that. And she is not passive-aggressive. Not in the least. It's just that sometimes people interpret her helpful suggestions as criticisms, which is certainly not her intention. She is not one to judge others&#x2015;no matter how ill-mannered, unkempt, or morally suspect they might be.<br><br>But hidden inside the socially awkward, fussy busybody is a woman who has more imagination,bigger dreams, and a warmer heart that anyone around her realizes. <br><br>When Britt-Marie walks out on her cheating husband and has to fend for herself in the miserable backwater town of Borg&#x2015;of which the kindest thing one can say is that it has a road going through it&#x2015;she is more than a little unprepared.

She finds herself being drawn into the daily doings of her fellow citizens, an odd assortment of miscreants, drunkards, layabouts&#x2015;and a handsome local policeman whose romantic attentions to Britt-Marie are as unmistakable as they are unwanted. Most alarming of all, she&#x2019;s given the impossible task of leading the supremely untalented children&#x2019;s soccer team to victory.

Knives. Spoons.<br> <br>In that order.<br> <br>Britt-Marie is certainly not the kind of person who judges other people. Far from it.<br> <br>But surely no civilized person would even think of arranging a cutlery drawer in a different way from how cutlery drawers are supposed to be arranged?<br> <br>We&#x2019;re not animals, are we?<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a Monday in January. She&#x2019;s sitting at a desk in the unemployment office. Admittedly there&#x2019;s no cutlery in sight, but it&#x2019;s on her mind because it sums up everything that&#x2019;s gone wrong recently. Cutlery should be arranged as it always has been, because life should go on unchanged. Normal life is presentable. In normal life you clean up the kitchen and keep your balcony tidy and take care of your children. It&#x2019;s hard work&#x2014;harder than one might think. In normal life you certainly don&#x2019;t find yourself sitting in the unemployment office.<br> <br>The girl who works here has staggeringly short hair, Britt-Marie thinks, like a man&#x2019;s. Not that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with that, of course&#x2014;it&#x2019;s modern, no doubt. The girl points at a piece of paper and smiles, evidently in a hurry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just fill in your name, social security number, and address here, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie has to be registered. As if she were a criminal. As if she has come to steal a job rather than find one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Milk and sugar?&#x201d; the girl asks, pouring some coffee into a plastic mug.<br> <br>Britt-Marie doesn&#x2019;t judge anyone. Far from it. But who would behave like that? A plastic mug! Are we at war? She&#x2019;d like to say just that to the girl, but because Kent is always urging Britt-Marie to &#x201c;be more socially aware&#x201d; she just smiles as diplomatically as she can and waits to be offered a coaster.<br> <br>Kent is Britt-Marie&#x2019;s husband. He&#x2019;s an entrepreneur. Incredibly, incredibly successful. Has business dealings with Germany and is extremely, extremely socially aware.<br> <br>The girl offers her two tiny disposable cartons of the sort of milk that doesn&#x2019;t have to be kept in the fridge. Then she holds out a plastic mug with plastic teaspoons protruding from it. Britt-Marie could not have looked more startled if she&#x2019;d been offered roadkill.<br> <br>She shakes her head and brushes her hand over the table as if it was covered in invisible crumbs. There are papers everywhere, in any old order. The girl clearly doesn&#x2019;t have time to tidy them up, Britt-Marie realizes&#x2014;she&#x2019;s probably far too busy with her career.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; says the girl pleasantly, turning back to the form, &#x201c;just write your address here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie fixes her gaze on her lap. She misses being at home with her cutlery drawer. She misses Kent, because Kent is the one who fills in all the forms.<br> <br>When the girl looks like she&#x2019;s about to open her mouth again, Britt-Marie interrupts her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You forgot to give me a coaster,&#x201d; says Britt-Marie, smiling, with all the social awareness she can muster. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to make marks on your table. Could I trouble you to give me something to put my . . . coffee cup on?&#x201d;<br> <br>She uses that distinctive tone, which Britt-Marie relies on whenever she has to summon all her inner goodness, to refer to it as a &#x201c;cup&#x201d; even though it is a plastic mug.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry, just put it anywhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if life was as simple as that. As if using a coaster or organizing the cutlery drawer in the right order didn&#x2019;t matter. The girl&#x2014;who clearly doesn&#x2019;t appreciate the value of coasters, or proper cups, or even mirrors, judging by her hairstyle&#x2014;taps her pen against the paper, by the &#x201c;address&#x201d; box.<br> <br>&#x201c;But surely we can&#x2019;t just put our cups on the table? That leaves marks on a table, surely you see that.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl glances at the surface of the desk, which looks as if toddlers have been trying to eat potatoes off it. With pitchforks. In the dark.<br> <br>&#x201c;It really doesn&#x2019;t matter; it&#x2019;s so old and scratched up already!&#x201d; she says with a smile.<br> <br>Britt-Marie is screaming inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you&#x2019;ve considered that it&#x2019;s because you don&#x2019;t use coasters,&#x201d; she mutters, not at all in a &#x201c;passive-aggressive&#x201d; way, which is how Kent&#x2019;s children once described her when they thought she wasn&#x2019;t listening. Britt-Marie is not actually passive-aggressive. She&#x2019;s considerate. After she heard Kent&#x2019;s children saying she was passive-aggressive she was extra considerate for several weeks.<br> <br>The unemployment office girl looks a little strained. &#x201c;Okay . . . what did you say your name was? Britt, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Britt-Marie. Only my sister calls me Britt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Britt-Marie, if you could just fill in the form. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie peers at the paper, which requires her to give assurances about where she lives and who she is. An unreasonable amount of paperwork is required these days just to be a human being. A preposterous amount of administration for society to let one take part. In the end she reluctantly fills in her name, social security number, and her cell phone number. The address box is left empty.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your educational background, Britt-Marie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie squeezes her handbag.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have you know that my education is excellent.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But no formal education?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For your information, I solve an enormous number of crosswords. Which is not the sort of thing one can do without an education.&#x201d;<br> <br>She takes a very small gulp of the coffee. It doesn&#x2019;t taste like Kent&#x2019;s coffee at all. Kent makes very good coffee. Everyone says so. Britt-Marie takes care of the coasters and Kent takes care of the coffee.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay . . . what sort of life experience do you have?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My latest employment was as a waitress. I had outstanding references.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl looks hopeful. &#x201c;And when was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nineteen seventy-eight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah . . . and you haven&#x2019;t worked since then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have worked every day since then. I&#x2019;ve helped my husband with his company.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again the girl looks hopeful. &#x201c;And what sorts of tasks did you perform in the company?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I took care of the children and saw to it that our home was presentable.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl smiles to hide her disappointment, as people do when they don&#x2019;t have the ability to distinguish between &#x201c;a place to live&#x201d; and &#x201c;a home.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s actually thoughtfulness that makes the difference. Because of thoughtfulness there are coasters and proper coffee cups and beds that are made so tightly in the mornings that Kent jokes with his acquaintances about how, if you stumble on the threshold on your way into the bedroom, there&#x2019;s &#x201c;a smaller risk of breaking your leg if you land on the floor than the bedspread.&#x201d; Britt-Marie loathes it when he talks that way. Surely civilized people lift their feet when they walk across bedroom thresholds?<br> <br>Whenever Britt-Marie and Kent go away, Britt-Marie sprinkles the mattress with baking soda for twenty minutes before she makes the bed. The baking soda absorbs dirt and humidity, leaving the mattress much fresher. Baking soda helps almost everything, in Britt-Marie&#x2019;s experience. Kent usually complains about being late; Britt-Marie clasps her hands together over her stomach and says: &#x201c;I absolutely must be allowed to make the bed before we leave, Kent. Just imagine if we die!&#x201d;<br> <br>This is the actual reason why Britt-Marie hates traveling. Death. Not even baking soda has any effect on death. Kent says she exaggerates, but people do actually drop dead all the time when they&#x2019;re away, and what would the landlord think if they had to break down the door only to find an unclean mattress? Surely they&#x2019;d conclude that Kent and Britt-Marie lived in their own dirt?<br> <br>The girl checks her watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>Britt-Marie feels her tone has a note of criticism in it.<br> <br>&#x201c;The children are twins and we have a balcony. It&#x2019;s more work than you think, having a balcony.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl nods tentatively.<br> <br>&#x201c;How old are your children?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kent&#x2019;s children. They&#x2019;re thirty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So they&#x2019;ve left home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Obviously.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re sixty-three years old?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; says Britt-Marie dismissively, as if this was highly irrelevant.<br> <br>The girl clears her throat as if, actually, it&#x2019;s very relevant indeed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Britt-Marie, quite honestly, because of the financial crisis and all that, I mean, there&#x2019;s a scarcity of jobs for people in your . . . situation.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl sounds a bit as if &#x201c;situation&#x201d; was not her first choice as a way of concluding the sentence. Britt-Marie smiles patiently.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kent says that the financial crisis is over. He&#x2019;s an entrepreneur, you must understand. So he understands these kind of things, which are possibly a little outside your field of competence.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl blinks for an unnecessary amount of time. Checks her watch. She seems uncomfortable, which vexes Britt-Marie. She quickly decides to give the girl a compliment, just to show her goodwill. She looks around the room for something to compliment her about, and finally manages to say, with as generous a smile as she can muster:<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a very modern hairstyle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Oh. Thanks,&#x201d; she replies, her fingertips moving self-consciously towards her scalp.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very courageous of you to wear your hair so short when you have such a large forehead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Why does the girl look offended? Britt-Marie wonders. Clearly that&#x2019;s what happens when you try to be sociable towards young people these days. The girl rises from her chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for coming, Britt-Marie. You are registered in our database. We&#x2019;ll be in touch!&#x201d;<br> <br>She holds out her hand to say good-bye. Britt-Marie stands up and places the plastic mug of coffee in her hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s difficult to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;m supposed to just sit and wait,&#x201d; counters Britt-Marie with a diplomatic smile, &#x201c;as if I didn&#x2019;t have anything better to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl swallows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, my colleague will be in touch with you about a jobseekers&#x2019; training course, an&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a course. I want a job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely, but it&#x2019;s difficult to say when something will turn up. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie takes a notebook from her pocket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall we say tomorrow, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Could something turn up tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl clears her throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it could, or I&#x2019;d rather . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie gets a pencil from her bag, eyes the pencil with some disapproval, and then looks at the girl.<br> <br>&#x201c;Might I trouble you for a pencil sharpener?&#x201d; she asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;A pencil sharpener?&#x201d; asks the girl, as if she had been asked for a thousand-year-old magical artifact.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to put our meeting on the list.&#x201d;<br> <br>Some people don&#x2019;t understand the value of lists, but Britt-Marie is not one of those people. She has so many lists that she has to keep a separate list to list all the lists. Otherwise anything could happen. She could die. Or forget to buy baking soda.<br> <br>The girl offers her a pen and says something to the effect of, &#x201c;Actually I don&#x2019;t have time tomorrow,&#x201d; but Britt-Marie is too busy peering at the pen to hear what she&#x2019;s saying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Surely we can&#x2019;t write lists in ink?&#x201d; she bursts out.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d; The girl says this with some finality. &#x201c;Is there anything else I can help you with today, Britt-Marie?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; Britt-Marie responds after a moment.<br> <br>Britt-Marie often says that. &#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Not as in &#x201c;ha-ha&#x201d; but as in &#x201c;aha,&#x201d; spoken in a particularly disappointed tone. Like when you find a wet towel thrown on the bathroom floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Immediately after saying this, Britt-Marie always firmly closes her mouth, to emphasize this is the last thing she intends to say on the subject. Although it rarely is the last thing.<br> <br>The girl hesitates. Britt-Marie grasps the pen as if it&#x2019;s sticky. Looks at the list marked &#x201c;Tuesday&#x201d; in her notebook, and, at the top, above &#x201c;Cleaning&#x201d; and &#x201c;Shopping,&#x201d; she writes &#x201c;Unemployment office to contact me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She hands back the pen.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was very nice to meet you,&#x201d; says the girl robotically. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be in touch!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; says Britt-Marie with a nod.<br> <br>Britt-Marie leaves the unemployment office. The girl is obviously under the impression that this is the last time they&#x2019;ll meet, because she&#x2019;s unaware of how scrupulously Britt-Marie sticks to her lists. Clearly the girl has never seen Britt-Marie&#x2019;s balcony.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s an astonishingly, astonishingly presentable balcony.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s January outside, a winter chill in the air but no snow on the ground&#x2014;below freezing without any evidence of it being so. The very worst time of year for balcony plants.<br> <br>After leaving the unemployment office, Britt-Marie goes to a supermarket that is not her usual supermarket, where she buys everything on her list. She doesn&#x2019;t like shopping on her own, because she doesn&#x2019;t like pushing the shopping cart. Kent always pushes the shopping cart while Britt-Marie walks at his side and holds on to a corner of it. Not because she&#x2019;s trying to steer, only that she likes holding on to things while he is also holding on to them. For the sake of that feeling they are going somewhere at the same time.<br> <br>She eats her dinner cold at exactly six o&#x2019;clock. She&#x2019;s used to sitting up all night waiting for Kent, so she tries to put his portion in the fridge. But the only fridge here is full of very small bottles of alcohol. She lowers herself onto a bed that isn&#x2019;t hers, while rubbing her ring finger, a habit she falls into when she&#x2019;s nervous.<br> <br>A few days ago she was sitting on her own bed, spinning her wedding ring, after cleaning the mattress extra carefully with baking soda. Now she&#x2019;s rubbing the white mark on her skin where the ring used to be.<br> <br>The building has an address, but it&#x2019;s certainly neither a place to live nor a home. On the floor are two rectangular plastic boxes for balcony flowers, but the hostel room doesn&#x2019;t have a balcony. Britt-Marie has no one to sit up all night waiting for.<br> <br>But she sits up anyway.</p><h2>An Owl Too Many</h2><p>When Emory Emmerick, an obnoxious guest at Balaclava College&#39;s Annual Owl Count is murdered, Professor Peter Shandy investigates</p><p><p>Charlotte MacLeod (1922-2005) was an internationally bestselling author of cozy mysteries. Born in Canada, she moved to Boston as a child, and lived in New England most of her life. After graduating from college, she made a career in advertising, writing copy for the Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company before moving on to Boston firm N. H. Miller &amp; Co., where she rose to the rank of vice president. In her spare time, MacLeod wrote short stories, and in 1964 published her first novel, a children's book called Mystery of the White Knight.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>McLeod's myriad fans, and other readers with funny bones, will welcome the return of Professor Peter Shandy and his quirky colleagues at Balaclava Agricultural College, seen before in The Corpse in Oozak's Pond . On a midnight owl-counting expedition, a net nastily set becomes a murder weapon. Adding the melodramatic abductions of two women, a tugboat journey on swollen floodwaters and hypnotized police officers, McLeod develops a high-flying farce with humor that ranges from broad slapstick to quiet witticisms. Highly memorable characters include the buxom and oft-abducted Viola Buddley, eager local newsman Cronkhite Swope and the endearingly eccentric heiress, Professor Winifred Binks. The latter's decisions to fund a TV station for the Massachusetts college and to back a struggling natural-foods company have several people more than casually interested in her assets. When Binks goes missing, real adventure follows. From the first flutter of owl feathers to the solution offered in the final pages, this murder most fowl is a hoot.

Like many a movie mystery, this one begins in the middle of the night, when Toby, trying to deliver a package at Grant&#x2019;s behest, finds himself with a corpse on his hands, a lump on his head, and an odd message from a dying man. Now in pursuit of a murderer, Toby and Grant, who proves to be no less acrobatic than he is resourceful, follow a trail of clues that leads them eventually to a den of Nazi sympathizers and finally to a nighttime confrontation on a mountaintop with a very determined and formidably well-armed killer. As always, Toby can count on the aid of his friends: the unsanitary dentist Shelly Minck, with whom Toby shares an office; the huge wrestler-turned-poet Jerry Butler; the suave Swiss little person Gunther Whertman, who has mastered as many languages as he has skills; and Mrs. Irene Plaut, Toby&#x2019;s daffy but dogged landlady. As always, too, all four lend Toby their loyalty and support, although they are more likely to add to the chaos. &#x201c;Kaminsky has such a good time writing, and he so loves the period, that the reader is swept along willy-nilly.&#x201d;&#x2014;New York Times Book Review &#x201c;Makes the totally wacky possible.... Peters [is] an unblemished delight.&#x201d;&#x2014;Washington Post</p><p>Toby Peters has rubbed elbows with, and taken a beating for, most of the brightest stars from Hollywood's 1940s heyday. Judy Garland, Errol Flynn, Bette Davis, Charlie Chaplin--this disheveled, taco-gulping L.A. private eye has worked for them all. Usually to his regret. In Stuart M. Kaminsky's wacky but charming <i>To Catch a Spy</i>, he adds the terminally suave Cary Grant to his client list.<p> As 1943 comes to an end, with Allied bombs battering Berlin and Americans celebrating a new pork bonus among their wartime food stamps, Grant hires Peters to make a late-night swap of money for "compromising documents." ("I'm not being blackmailed over some crime or sexual indiscretion," Grant insists. "It's more important than that.") However, the mysterious messenger is shot before he can hand Peters the papers. His dying words: "George Hall." It's only the vaguest of clues, but enough to send Toby and Grant--who's working for British Intelligence Services--on a bungling chase that leads to a second corpse, a cabal of Nazi sympathizers, and a perilous confrontation on a moonlit precipice.</p><p> What's most remarkable about this 22nd Peters outing is that it's just as welcome as the first, 1977's <i>Bullet for a Star</i>. Kaminsky, a film historian, employs his knowledge of Tinsel Town's "golden age" to both nostalgic and comic effect. More lighthearted than 2001's <i>A Few Minutes Past Midnight</i>, but still featuring Kaminsky's usually suspect cast of supporting eccentrics--including Irene Plaut, Toby's addled landlady, and dentist-from-hell Shelly Minck--<i>To Catch a Spy</i> is Raymond Chandler by way of the Marx Brothers. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>Stuart M. Kaminsky is the prolific Edgar-award winning author of more than seventy novels and three detective series, including the popular Toby Peters mysteries featuring stars of Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age. Kaminsky lives in Florida.</p><h2>An Angel to Watch Over Me: True Stories of Children&#39;s Encounters with Angels</h2><p>Perhaps because children have not yet learned to disbelieve what their eyes, ears, and hearts tell them, they seem to have a special closeness with angels. After the publication of Joan Wester Anderson's New York Times bestseller WHERE ANGELS WALK, people urged her to write a book entirely about children's experiences with angels -- and sent along their own personal narratives as witness to these miraculous visitations.<br>AN ANGEL TO WATCH OVER ME is the result: a wonderful collection of stories that documents and describes the extraordinary encounters between children and celestial visions. There's the grandmotherly angel who consoles an ailing girl in a hospital emergency room, and the angel who helps a Texas boy lose his fear of thunderstorms. There are angels who combat darkness, bring glad tidings, and offer comfort. For those who read this wondrous book, angels become a warm and loving presence in everyday life, a blessed part of being.</p><p>This is a wonderful and inspiring book to share with your child. How many of us believe in angels, and realize they are our divine protectors? This book is a perfect way of reminding your little one--who can often be scared by &#39;monsters&#39; under the bed, or other such things--that God, and His angels, are watching over every one of us each and every day. The author, Joan Wester Anderson, wrote this book because after the publication of her title WHERE ANGELS WALK, lots of people asked her to do a book that was devoted entirely to children&#39;s encounters with celestial visitors. To further remind your little one of the presence of angels in everyday life, Joan and I included a section at the back that offers angel prayers, angel poems, angel songs, and angel stories and legends from around the world. We hope you and your child find reassurance and inspiration from this title, for that was its intent. --E. Zack, Sr. EditorThis was the only one of the series written for children.&nbsp; The hardcover is long since out of print, as is the Spanish language version of it.&nbsp; However, the paperback is still out there. --author</p><h2>America the Beautiful: Together We Stand: Together We Stand</h2><p>AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL: TOGETHER WE STAND<br><br>Each of our presidents has had a unique vision of America.

About it, School Library Journal wrote, "Young readers will delight in Goode's humorous images of the prehistoric giants festooned in extravagant costumes and the dinosaur images peeking down from the gilded moldings of the palace's sumptuous rooms. ... A delightful addition to standard fairy-tale collections." Diane lives with her husband in Wachung, New Jersey, with their two dogs, a yellow Labrador retriever and a Welsh corgi. Their son, Peter, is an artist.K-Gr 5-When illustrations from 10 prominent children's book artists are combined with the words from Bates's "America the Beautiful" and quotations from a range of United States presidents, the result is a beautiful, patriotic ode to the best of our nation. This multifaceted concept is elegantly executed in a book that will be useful to anyone seeking to engage children in learning more about American history, landmarks, and symbols. Words from Jimmy Carter set the tone, saying, "We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams." Each illustration, masterfully rendered by artists such as Yuyi Morales, Jon J Muth, LeUyen Pham, and Chris Soentpiet, among other stars, depicts a multiethnic, multicultural view of the possibilities America represents. The book design successfully integrates the various elements. Pictorial spreads leave one panel open for the quotations, while Bates's words appear in large type at the bottom or top of each illustration. The quotations all focus on helping others and being our best selves, individually and as a country. In a time when political debate is sharply divided, this book reminds us that some ideals are part of our national heritage and stand above the disagreements.-Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Now Loretta finishes that story, and the second half of her life is every bit as remarkable and inspiring as the first. In a friendly, down-home style that belies her stature as country musics most celebrated performer, Loretta writes candidly about the price of fame and the stresses of stardom; tells of friends and family shes loved and lost along the way; and shares secrets not included in her first book. But at the heart of this memoir is her stormy relationship with Doo, the man she married at thirteen and stayed with until he died, through his drinking, their violent arguments, and their passionate reconciliations. Loretta reveals the devotion behind one of the hardest love stories in the world. Filled with intimate portraits of country legends, and brimming with folksy humor, this personal tale of grit, determination, and loyalty will enthrall Lorettas countless fans and anyone who adores a good old-fashioned love story.</p><p><strong>Loretta Lynn</strong> marked her fortieth anniversary in show business in the year 2000. A mother at fourteen, she had four children by the time she was eighteen and taught herself to play the guitar. She became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1963, and the following year, her first album went Number 1. She was duet partners with Ernest Tubb and the late Conway Twitty, and recorded songs both beloved and controversial (like "The Pill" and "Rated X") as a solo artist. Her first book,<em>Coal Miner's Daughter</em>, hit the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list and became an Oscar-winning film. She continues to perform and to command a devoted audience. Loretta Lynn lives in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.<br><br><strong>Patsi Bale Cox</strong> collaborated on the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling<em>Nickel Dreams</em>, the autobiography of Tanya Tucker, and on <em>The View from Nashville</em> and<em>Fifty Years Down a Country Road</em> with Ralph Emery. She is a member of the Grammy nominating committee in the liner note category and lives in Nashville, Tennessee.When asked to write her first memoir, Lynn was in her early 30s: "I hadn't never done nothing with my life except sing and have babies, and I didn't think I had a life to talk about." But Coal Miner's Daughter, the story of the dirt-poor Kentucky girl who married at 14, had four of her six children before she was 21 and went on to become one of country music's most successful recording artists, captured the American imagination. In this follow-up, Lynn mostly focuses on her marriage and the trials and pleasures of Nashville stardom, including fond recollections of friends like Conway Twitty and Tammy Wynnette. Lynn admits that the passing of her husband, Doo drunk, abusive, womanizing and yet her most loyal, trusted companion in 1996, freed her to write more openly. There are no stunning revelations here, rather a series of small, genuine ones about family and career. Though her grammar may make purists flinch ("I thought me and Doo was no longer husband and wife just because he throwed me out"), Lynn's literary voice is as natural and endearing as her songs. Many tales have a conspiratorial tone, and Lynn is quite willing to incriminate herself ("I ain't proud of that story or this next one, but this one has such a good ending I got to tell it anyway"). Honest and always entertaining, Lynn's memoir should delight country music fans and perhaps win her some new ones. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Keturah and Lord Death</h2><p>Martine Leavitt offers a spellbinding story, interweaving elements of classic fantasy and high romance in this National Book Award Finalist.

The tale of a terrible event that devastates three families, after two young girls discover by of an unsupervised baby on an empty street, <em>Every Secret Thing</em> is a bravura demonstration of the extraordinary storytelling skill that has won Laura Lippman every major literary prize bestowed upon mystery writers, including the Edgar�, the Anthony, the Shamus, and the Agatha Awards. <br></p></p><p><p>Since her debut in 1997, Laura Lippman has won virtually every major prize in the mystery-writing field and earned the highest critical praise for her Tess Monaghan series, which has been called "spectacular" (<em>New York Times</em>), "terrific fun" (<em>Washington Post</em>), "a delight" (<em>Baltimore Sun</em>), and "the best mystery writing around" (<em>Village Voice</em>). Now Lippman steps outside her series to deliver her darkest, most troubling tale -- and vaults into the crime-fiction elite with a haunting story of murder, fate's accidents, and the stories we tell ourselves when we try to make sense of the unthinkable.</p><p>On a July afternoon two little girls, banished from a birthday party, take a wrong turn onto an unfamiliar Baltimore street -- and encounter an abandoned stroller with a baby inside it. Dutiful Alice Manning and unpredictable Ronnie Fuller only want to be helpful, to be good. People like children who are good, Alice thinks. But whatever the girls' real intentions, things go horribly awry and three families are destroyed.</p><p>Seven years later Alice and Ronnie are heading home again -- only separately this time, their fragile bond long shattered, their secrets still closely kept. Advised to avoid each other, they enter a world where they essentially have no past.

Through the dust of the demolished buildings, screams echo off the rubble. Two abandoned Chinese soldiers are trapped and desperately outnumbered inside the walled city. What they'll encounter will haunt them. But in the face of horror, they'll learn that resistance and bravery cannot be destroyed by the enemy.<br><br>Ethan Young (<i>Tails</i>) delves into World War II's forgotten tragedy, the devastating Japanese invasion of Nanjing, and tells a heart-wrenching tale of war, loss, and defiance. Beautifully illustrated in black and white.<br>"In <i>Nanjing</i>, cartoonist Ethan Young tells an intimate story against an epic landscape. Bold, heart-breaking, and gorgeously rendered."&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;</i>Eisner and Printz Award-winner Gene Luen Yang<i> (Boxers &amp; Saints, American Born Chinese)</i><br><br>"Young&#x2019;s decision not to glorify violence or titillate the reader in any way avoids a common pitfall and heightens the drama. This is stunning, stirring historical fiction by a creator at the height of his craft." (Starred review) <i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Young&#x2019;s is just one chapter in an overwhelmingly grievous episode of the 20th century. The specifics might be fictional amidst a historical backdrop, but in creating names, depicting individual faces both living and dead, Young conjures a haunting microcosm amidst a horrifying event of epic proportions." &#x2014;<i>Smithsonian APAC Bookdragon</i><br><br>"A rugged black and white style ... a little Kubert, a little Tardi." <i>&#x2014;The Beat</i><br><br>"Nanjing: The Burning City deserves a spot alongside not only historical comics, but wartime prose and non-fiction as well.

He has also drawn and designed for advertising, video games, independent films, T-shirt designs, album covers, logos, fantasy &amp; sci-fi illustration and much more. Young is currently the lead storyboard artist for 'The Centsables', a saturday morning cartoon on Fox Business Channel. The author lives in Ithaca, N.Y..Acclaimed comics creator Young (<i>Tails: Life in Progress</i>) has released his most ambitious project yet: an intimate look at what&#x2019;s known as the Rape of Nanjing: six weeks during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937&#x2013;38, in which Japanese troops systematically tortured, sexually assaulted, and executed hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians. Although records of the massacre have largely been destroyed, Young draws on the best information available to tell a fictionalized account of two Chinese soldiers attempting to escape their city. Along the way, they meet several equally desperate refugees, and their destinies become intertwined. Young&#x2019;s black-and-white artwork is heart-wrenchingly beautiful in its depiction of countless tragedies, and his writing remains tight throughout. Most notable among the fascinating cast is Yan, a battle-hardened wife and mother who retains her agency during the infamous violence against women. Young&#x2019;s decision not to glorify violence or titillate the reader in any way avoids a common pitfall and heightens the drama. This is stunning, stirring historical fiction by a creator at the height of his craft.

It's the Jazz Age, with romance and booze aplenty--even when Prohibition kicks in--and Mazie never turns down a night on the town. But her high spirits mask a childhood rooted in poverty, and her diary, always close at hand, holds her dearest secrets.<br><br>When the Great Depression hits, Mazie's life is on the brink of transformation. Addicts and bums roam the Bowery; homelessness is rampant. If Mazie won't help them, then who? When she opens the doors of The Venice to those in need, this ticket taking, fun-time girl becomes the beating heart of the Lower East Side, and in defining one neighborhood helps define the city.<br><br>Then, more than ninety years after Mazie began her diary, it's discovered by a documentarian in search of a good story. Who was Mazie Phillips, really? A chorus of voices from the past and present fill in some of the mysterious blanks of her adventurous life.<br><br>Inspired by the life of a woman who was profiled in Joseph Mitchell's classic <em>Up in the Old Hotel</em>, SAINT MAZIE is infused with Jami Attenberg's signature wit, bravery, and heart. Mazie's rise to "sainthood"--and her irrepressible spirit--is unforgettable.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> Jami Attenberg&#x2019;s <em>Saint Mazie</em> couldn&#x2019;t be more different from her popular <em>The Middlesteins</em>, in that it is a) historical not contemporary, b) loosely based on a real woman who lived in early 20th century New York City instead of on an all-too-real fictional character in suburban Chicago and c) told as an oral history instead of as a traditional narrative. Still, this novel exhibits the same kind of wit and depth and heart of the earlier one. Mazie Phillips was a depression-era movie-theater-owner in New York during the Depression; she was big-hearted and bawdy, enough of a neighborhood figure that she became the subject of a 1940 New Yorker profile by the journalist Joseph Mitchell. Starting with his observations&#x2014;&#x201c;Mazie has a genuine fondness for bums and undoubtedly knows more bums than any other person in the city&#x201d;&#x2014;Attenberg weaves an astonishingly heartfelt story of poverty and loss (one of Mazie&#x2019;s beloved, orphaned sisters moves to California to become a dancer and is essentially lost to her forever), unconventionality (there&#x2019;s a lot of socially &#x201c;inappropriate&#x201d; sex and love in this book) and, to use a word from that era, &#x201c;moxie.&#x201d; With all her tough talk and bootstrap-pulling, Mazie could grow into a clich� &#x2013; the loose woman with a heart of gold &#x2013; but Attenberg never lets her, preferring instead to take Mitchell&#x2019;s sketch and draw all over it with fictional interviews and diaries until Mazie becomes a complex and irresistible real-life woman. She may have lived in a very specific era, but thanks to Attenberg, she has become a character for the ages. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><b>Jami Attenberg</b> is the author of a story collection,<em> Instant Love</em>, and three novels,<em> The Kept Man, The Melting Season</em>, and <em>The Middlesteins</em>, which was a finalist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize for Fiction.

May 2017 saw the opening of Japan House Sao Paulo, whose inaugural exhibition &#39;Bamboo: The Material That Built Japan&#39; drew over 300,000 visitors. From June 2017 to February 2018 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York mounted another bamboo show that was seen by about 400,000. From 27 November, the Musee du quai Branly in Paris will present the largest-ever exhibition on the subject. This authoritative catalogue of 323 works from the Naej Collection thus appears at a moment when a new global audience has emerged. The Naej Collection is especially strong in works by leading artists from 1850 to 1950, when great craft dynasties were established and first Osaka and then Tokyo emerged as major centres of artistic basketry. The catalogue breaks new ground by combining dramatic photography with precious documentary information drawn from signatures and inscriptions, making it not merely the visual record of a great collection but the essential reference work for a developing field of connoisseurship.

A predicament arises, and the children's response--simple and immediate--offers Paley the purest evidence of kindness she has ever seen. </p><p> In subsequent encounters, "the Teddy story" draws forth other tales of impulsive goodness from Paley's listeners. Just so, it resonates through this book as one story leads to another--taking surprising turns, intersecting with the narrative unfolding before us, and illuminating the moral meanings that children may be learning to create among themselves. </p><p> Paley's journey takes us into the different worlds of urban London, Chicago, Oakland, and New York City, and to a close-knit small town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Her own story connects those of children from nursery school to high school, and circles back to her elderly mother, whose experiences as a frightened immigrant girl, helped through a strange school and a new language by another child, reappear in the story of a young Mexican American girl. Thus the book quietly brings together the moral life of the very young and the very old. With her characteristic unpretentious charm, Paley lets her listeners and storytellers take us down unexpected paths, where the meeting of story and real life make us wonder: Are children wiser about the nature of kindness than we think they are? </p></p><p>This is an extraordinarily suggestive book, written for all of us who are interested in children and their educational lives.

Accompanying his wife Kate to a memorial marking the five-year anniversary of the crash, Corey's curiosity is aroused by what appears to be a concerted effort by Kate's fellow federal agents to keep him--and her--from investigating a case that appears to be closed. Corey's detecting skills lead him to two witnesses to the crash, who were enjoying an adulterous interlude on the beach at the time the plane went down--and videotaping their sexual escapades while what appears to be a terrorist missile attack takes place in the background. What ratchets up the tension in this capably written thriller is what the reader knows but Corey doesn't as he heads for a showdown with those responsible for the official cover-up as the clock ticks down to the morning of September 11, 2001. DeMille's deft touch with a riddle wrapped in an enigma--what really happened to Flight 800--makes his "what if" scenario a more than plausible theory; you don't have to believe in conspiracies or government cover-ups to find his latest engrossing, entertaining, and enlightening. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p> </p><p></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> <b>Nelson DeMille on <i>Night Fall</i>: An Exclusive Essay</b> <br></p><p> It was a true story, the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island in 1996, that inspired Nelson DeMille to write the fictional <i>Night Fall</i>.

Don&#39;t Forget the Soap!</h2><p>When Plug&#39;s mother sends him to the store to buy soap, he promises not to forget his errand, but soon he does forget, leading to a series of hilarious misadventures.</p><p>Andrew Glass has illustrated many books for young readers, including &#34;Soap! Soap! Don&#39;t Forget the Soap!: An Appalachian Tale&#34; by Tom Birdseye and &#34;The Wondrous Whirligig: The Wright Brothers&#39; First Flying Machine,&#34; which he also wrote. Booklist has called his art &#34;comic [and] action-packed.&#34; He lives in New York City.Kindergarten-Grade 2-This droll, cumulative story tells of an ever-so-forgetful boy, Plug, whose loving mother sends him to the store for soap. Concentrating on his mission as he walks along, Plug calls out the refrain of the title, causing an elderly woman to fall into the creek. She dunks him and leaves him with a new line that takes its place in his memory instead of the old one: "'What a mess I've become, but now you're one, too!'" This sentence offends the next person he meets and the chain of mishaps continues until a bedraggled but triumphant Plug returns home with the soap. This version differs from Richard Chase's tale of the same title in Grandfather Tales (Houghton, 1973) in its emphasis on motherly love and in its softened, less punitive approach. Students may recognize a similar story in Pat Hutchins's Don't Forget the Bacon (Greenwillow, 1976). Glass's bright, action-filled illustrations are reminiscent of Stephen Gammell's work in Cynthia Rylant's The Relatives Came (Bradbury, 1985). Birdseye's vivid language, use of repetition, and tone invite oral readings.

In this volume, the writings of Subcomandante Marcos give eloquent expression to this movement, revealing both its philo-sophical foundations and its tactical ingenuity. I believe his words and the statements of the Zapatistas can inspire a new generation of activists and let them understand that it is possible for ordinary people, without military power, without wealth, to challenge state power successfully on behalf of social justice.

Not exactly the type who tended to rent an apartment in her slightly shabby neighborhood.</p><p> She scrambled to her feet and brushed off her butt, groaning as she felt the wet spot.</p><p> "Hi," she said, smiling as she carefully took a step back. "You're, um..."</p><p> Damn. Mrs. Ford, her <i>other </i>neighbor, had told her the guy's name. Also that he had recently left the military, kept to himself and apparently had no job. It wasn't a combination that made Elissa comfy.</p><p> "Walker Buchanan. I live upstairs."</p><p> Alone. No visitors and he didn't go out much. Oh, yeah. Good times. Still, she'd been raised to be polite, so she smiled and said, "Hi. I'm Elissa Towers."</p><p> Under any other circumstances, she would have found another way out of her dilemma, but there was no way she could loosen the lug nuts herself and she couldn't just sit here praying to the tire gods.</p><p> She pointed. "If you could be burly for a second, that would be fabulous."</p><p> "Burly?" The corner of his mouth twitched.</p><p> "You're a guy, this is a guy thing. It's a natural fit." He folded his impressive arms over a rather impressive chest. "What happened to women wanting to be independent and equal in the world?"</p><p> Hmm, so there was a brain behind those dark eyes and maybe the potential for humor. That was good. Neighbors of serial killers always said the guy was so <i>nice. </i>Elissa wasn't sure Walker qualified as nice, which was, in a twisted way, a bit of a relief.</p><p> "We should have worked on our upper body strength first. Besides, you offered."</p><p> "Yes, I did."</p><p> He picked up the wrench, squatted down and in one quick movement that left her feeling both inadequate and bitter, loosened the first nut. The other three followed just as fast.</p><p> "Thanks," she said with a smile. "I'll take it from here."</p><p> "I'm already involved," he told her. "I can put on the spare in a couple of seconds."</p><p> Or so he thought. "Yes, well, that's a funny story," she said. "I don't have a spare. It's big and bulky and really weighs down the car."</p><p> He straightened. "You need a spare." His statement of the obvious irritated her. "Thanks for the advice, but as I don't have one, it's not very helpful."</p><p> "So what do you do now?"</p><p> "I say thank you." She glanced pointedly at the stairs leading to his apartment. When he didn't move, she added, "I don't want to keep you."</p><p> His gaze dipped from her face to the large nylon bag on wheels, lying next to her on the driveway. His mouth tightened in disapproval.</p><p> "There is no way you're going to carry that tire somewhere yourself," he said flatly.</p><p> Definitely not nice, she thought. "I don't carry, I drag. I've done it before. The tire place I go to is less than a mile from here. I walk there, Randy patches it for me and I walk back. It's easy. Good exercise, even. So thank you for your help and have a nice day."</p><p> She reached for the tire in question. He stepped between her and it.</p><p> "I'll take it," he told her.</p><p> "No, thank you. I'm <i>fine.</i>"</p><p> He topped her by at least seven or eight inches and he had to outweigh her by a good sixty pounds... every ounce of them muscle. As he narrowed his gaze and glared at her, she had the feeling he was trying to intimidate her. He was doing a good job of it, too, but she couldn't let him know that. She was tough. She was determined. She was... "Mommy, can I have toast?"</p><p> Why was life always about timing?</p><p> She turned to her daughter standing at the entrance to their apartment. "Sure, Zoe. But let me help. I'll be right in."</p><p> Zoe smiled. "Okay, Mommy." The screen door slammed shut.</p><p> Elissa glanced back at Walker, only to find that stealth guy had used her moment of inattention to pick up her tire and walk toward his very expensive, very out-of-place-for-this-neighborhood SUV.</p><p> "You can't take that tire," she said as she hurried after him. "It's mine."</p><p> "I'm not stealing it," he said in a bored tone. "I'm taking it to be fixed. Where do you usually go?"</p><p> "I'm not going to tell you." Ha! That should stop him.</p><p> "Fine. I'll go where I want." He tossed the tire into the SUV and slammed the back shut.</p><p> "Wait! Stop." When, exactly, had she lost control? He turned to her. "Are you really worried I'm going to disappear with your tire?"</p><p> "No. Of course not. It's just... I don't..."</p><p> He waited patiently.</p><p> "I don't know you," she snapped. "I keep to myself. I don't want to owe you."</p><p> He surprised her by nodding. "I can respect that. Where do you want me to take the tire?"</p><p> So he wasn't giving up. "Randy's Brake and Tire Center." She gave him directions. "But you have to wait a second. I need to get a pair of earrings."</p><p> "For Randy?" He raised his eyebrows.</p><p> "For Randy's sister. It's her birthday." She drew in a breath, hating to explain. "It's how I pay for the work."</p><p> She waited for the judgment, or at the very least, a smart-ass comment. Instead Walker shrugged.</p><p> "Go get them."</p><p> THE TRIP TO RANDY'S Brake and Tire Center took three minutes and when Walker parked, he found a short, beer-bellied older man waiting for him.</p><p> Randy himself, Walker would guess as he opened the car door.</p><p> "You got Elissa's tire?" the man asked.</p><p> "In back."</p><p> Randy eyed Walker's BMW X5. "Bet you take that to the dealer," he said.</p><p> "I haven't had to yet, but I will."</p><p> "Nice wheels." Randy walked around to the rear of the SUV and opened the back. When he saw the tire in question, he groaned. "What is it with Elissa? They're doing construction across from where she works. I swear, she finds every loose nail hanging around on the road. Always in this tire, too. There's more patch on it than rubber."</p><p> More patch than tread, Walker thought as he stared at the worn tire. "She should replace it."</p><p> Randy looked at him. "You think? Thing is, you can't get blood from a rock. Hey, times are tight with everyone, right? Got my earrings?"</p><p> Walker took the small envelope out of his shirt pocket and handed it over. Randy looked inside and whistled. "Very nice. Janice is gonna love them. Okay, give me ten minutes and I'll have this ready to go."</p><p> Walker hadn't wanted to help his neighbor in the first place. He'd taken a short-term lease on the apartment to give himself time to figure out what to do with the rest of his life in quiet and solitude. He didn't know anyone in the neighborhood and he didn't want anyone to know him.</p><p> Except for a brief but surprisingly effective interrogation from the old lady living downstairs, he'd kept to himself for nearly six weeks. Until he'd seen Elissa struggling with the lug nuts.</p><p> He'd wanted to ignore her. That had been his plan. But he couldn't -- which was a character flaw he needed to work on. Now, faced with a crappy tire that was likely to blow the second she hit sixty on the 405, he found himself unable to walk away again.</p><p> "Give me a new one," he muttered.</p><p> Randy raised his bushy eyebrows. "You're buying Elissa a tire?"</p><p> Walker nodded. Best-case scenario, he would replace both rear tires. But he only had the one wheel with him.</p><p> The older man puffed out his chest. "How, exactly, do you know Elissa and Zoe?"</p><p> Zoe? Walker blanked for a second, then remembered the kid he'd seen around. Elissa's daughter.</p><p> He owed this guy nothing in the way of explanations. Still, he found himself saying, "I live upstairs."</p><p> Randy narrowed his gaze. "Elissa's a friend of mine. Don't you go messing with her."</p><p> Walker knew that even after an all-night bender, he could take the old guy and have enough left over to run a four-minute mile. Randy's posturing would have been almost funny -- except it was sincere. He cared about Elissa.</p><p> "I'm just doing her a favor," Walker said easily.</p><p> "We're neighbors, nothing more."</p><p> "Okay, then. Because Elissa's been through a lot and she doesn't deserve to be messed with."</p><p> "I agree."</p><p> Walker had no idea what they were talking about, but anything to move the conversation along. Randy picked up the flat and carried it toward the garage.</p><p> "I've got a couple of good tires that'll be a whole lot safer than this one. Because it's for Elissa, I'll give you a good deal."</p><p> "I appreciate it."</p><p> Randy glance...</p></p><h2>The Hellraiser Chronicles</h2><p>Describes the characters and plots of the first three Hellraiser films.</p><p>&#34;Hellraiser is the best horror film ever to be made in Britain.&#34;</p><h2>Book Play: Creative Adventures in Handmade Books</h2><p>Make books as interesting as the stories you want to tell!

For centuries since, she has been the object of debate, speculation, and the fascination so often accorded illustrious figures in history. Antonia Fraser&#x2019;s lavish and engaging portrait excites compassion and regard for the queen, immersing the reader not only in the coming-of-age of a graceful woman, but in the culture of an unparalleled time and place.</p><p>In the past, Antonia Fraser's bestselling histories and biographies have focused on people and events in her native England, from <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i> to <i>Faith and Treason: The Story of the Gunpowder Plot</i>. Now she crosses the Channel to limn the life of France's unhappiest queen, bringing along her gift for fluent storytelling, vivid characterization, and evocative historical background. Marie Antoinette (1755-93) emerges in Fraser's sympathetic portrait as a goodhearted girl woefully undereducated and poorly prepared for the dynastic political intrigues into which she was thrust at age 14, when her mother, Empress Maria Theresa, married her off to the future Louis XVI to further Austria's interests in France. Far from being the licentious monster later depicted by the radicals who sent her to the guillotine at the height of the French Revolution, young Marie Antoinette was quite prudish, as well as thoroughly humiliated by her husband's widely known failure to have complete intercourse with her for seven long years (the gory details were reported to any number of concerned royal parties, including her mother and brother). She compensated by spending lavishly on clothes and palaces, but Fraser points out that this hardly made her unique among 18th-century royalty, and in any case the causes of the Revolution went far beyond one woman's frivolities. The moving final chapters show Marie Antoinette gaining in dignity and courage as the Revolution stripped her of everything, subjected her to horrific brutalities (a mob paraded the head of her closest female friend on a pike below her window), and eventually took her life. Fraser makes no attempt to hide the queen's shortcomings, in particular her poor political skills, but focuses on her personal warmth and noble bearing during her final ordeal. It's another fine piece of popular historical biography to add to Fraser's already impressive bibliography. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>France&#39;s beleaguered queen, Marie Antoinette, wrongly accused of uttering the infamous &#34;Let them eat cake,&#34; was the subject of ridicule and curiosity even before her death; she has since been the object of debate and speculation and the fascination so often accorded tragic figures in history. Married in mere girlhood, this essentially lighthearted, privileged, but otherwise unremarkable child was thrust into an unparalleled time and place, and was commanded by circumstance to play a significant role in history. Antonia Fraser&#39;s lavish and engaging portrait of Marie Antoinette, one of the most recognizable women in European history, excites compassion and regard for all aspects of her subject, immersing the reader not only in the coming-of-age of a graceful woman, but also in the unraveling of an era.</p><h2>Gastonia 1929: The Story of the Loray Mill Strike</h2><p>Of the wave of labor strikes that swept through the South in 1929, the one at the Loray Mill in Gastonia, North Carolina, is perhaps the best remembered. In <i>Gastonia 1929</i> John Salmond provides the first detailed account of the complex events surrounding the strike at the largest textile mill in the Southeast. His compelling narrative unravels the confusing story of the shooting of the town's police chief, the trials of the alleged killers, the unsolved murder of striker Ella May Wiggins, and the strike leaders' conviction and subsequent flight to the Soviet Union. Describing the intensifying climate of violence in the region, Salmond presents the strike within the context of the southern vigilante tradition and as an important chapter in American economic and labor history in the years after World War I. He draws particular attention to the crucial role played by women as both supporters and leaders of the strike, and he highlights the importance of race and class issues in the unfolding of events.<br><br></p><p>"[This] solid contribution to the historiography . . . adds a new dimension to our understanding of those troubling days. . . . <i>Gastonia</i> is compellingly told and well written."-- <i>Mississippi Quarterly</i> <br>John A.

At the same time, Berlin has also been a dynamic center of artistic and intellectual innovation. If Paris was the &#34;Capital of the Nineteenth Century,&#34; Berlin was to become the signature city for the next hundred years. Once a symbol of modernity, in the Thirties it became associated with injustice and the abuse of power. After 1945, it became the iconic City of the Cold War. Since the fall of the Wall, Berlin has again come to represent humanity&#39;s aspirations for a new beginning, tempered by caution deriving from the traumas of the recent past. David Clay Large&#39;s definitive history of Berlin is framed by the two German unifications of 1871 and 1990. Between these two events several themes run like a thread through the city&#39;s history: a persistent inferiority complex; a distrust among many ordinary Germans, and the national leadership of the &#34;unloved city&#39;s&#34; electric atmosphere, fast tempo, and tradition of unruliness; its status as a magnet for immigrants, artists, intellectuals, and the young; the opening up of social, economic, and ethnic divisions as sharp as the one created by the Wall.</p><p>Founded in the 13th century as a trading post on a windswept Prussian plain, Berlin was something of an accidental capital. It was selected by Chancellor Bismarck after Germany's unification in 1871, in part because the choice of any other city--Munich, say, or Frankfurt--would have provoked terrible regional rivalries. As it was, the rest of Germany simply looked down on the hinterland Berliners as, in historian David Clay Large's words, "parvenus whose civilization was hardly more substantial than the Prussian sands on which their town was built."<p> The people who soon swarmed to Berlin from all over Germany--and elsewhere in Europe--put their scorn for the city aside, and they turned it, writes Large, "into a hothouse of modernity, a place that pursued change like a drug." That change becomes a dominant theme as Large charts the rapid growth of Berlin in the early 1900s from regional backwater to a leading European center of socialist politics and the arts. Berlin's avant-garde culture and freewheeling atmosphere made it a target of the Nazi leadership, which put in motion grandiose schemes of social and civil engineering intended to remake it into an imperial city the likes of which the world had never known. Devastated, instead, by World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II and divided by the victorious Allies for four decades afterward, Berlin was, until recently, gray and unattractive compared with many other German cities--and, writes Large, that suited many Germans who "harbored the conviction that Berlin, the former Nazi capital, had no business being pretty or glamorous." </p><p> In <i>Berlin</i>, David Large brings the city's recent past to life. Though lacking the literary flair that makes Alexandra Richie's wider-ranging history of Berlin, <i>Faust's Metropolis</i>, so readable, it stands as a substantial contribution to the historical literature. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>David Clay Large</b>, Professor of History at Montana State University, is a specialist in modern German history.

Some whisper of a tragic love affair. Others say he is so aloof and passionless that not even the greatest beauty could capture his attention. But on this dazzling afternoon, one woman did catch the duke&#x2019;s eye&#x2014;and she was the only female in the room who wasn&#x2019;t even trying. Christine Derrick is intrigued by the handsome duke...all the more so when he invites her to become his mistress. <br><br>What red-blooded woman wouldn&#x2019;t enjoy a tumble in the bedsheets with a consummate lover&#x2014;with no strings and no questions asked. An infuriating lady with very definite views on men, morals, and marriage, Christine confounds Wulfric at every turn. Yet even as the lone wolf of the Bedwyn clan vows to seduce her any way he can, something strange and wonderful is happening.

"And your eyes are very bright. I hope you are not coming down with a fever."<br><br>Christine laughed. "I have been at the vicarage, playing with the children," she explained. "Alexander wanted to play cricket, but after a few minutes it became clear that Marianne could not catch a ball and Robin could not hit one. We played hide-and-seek instead, though Alexander thought it was somewhat beneath his dignity now that he is nine years old until I asked him how his poor aunt must feel, then, at the age of twenty-nine. I was it all the time, of course. We had great fun until Charles poked his head out of the study window and asked us--rhetorically, I suppose--how he was ever to get his sermon finished with all the noise we were making. So Hazel gave us all a glass of lemonade and shooed the children off to the parlor to read quietly, poor things, and I came home."<br><br>"I suppose," her eldest sister, Eleanor, said, looking up from her book and observing Christine over the tops of her spectacles, "you did not wear your bonnet while you frolicked with our niece and nephews. That is not just a flush. It is a sunburn."<br><br>"How can one poke one's head into small hiding places if it is swollen to twice its size with a bonnet?" Christine asked reasonably. She began to arrange the flowers she had cut from the garden on her way inside, in a vase of water she had brought with her from the kitchen.<br><br>"And your hair looks like a bird's nest," Eleanor added.<br><br>"That is soon corrected." Christine rumpled her short curls with both hands and laughed. "There. Is that better?"<br><br>Eleanor shook her head before returning her attention to her book--but not before smiling.<br><br>There was a comfortable hush in the room again while they all concentrated upon their chosen activities. But the silence--tempered by the chirping of birds and the whirring of insects from beyond the open window--was broken after a few minutes by the sound of horses' hooves clopping along the village street in the direction of Hyacinth Cottage, and the rumble of wheels. There was more than one horse, and the wheels were heavy ones. It must be the carriage from Schofield Park, Baron Renable's country seat, which was a mere two miles away, Christine thought absently.<br><br>None of them took any particular notice of the carriage's approach. Lady Renable often used it when she went visiting, even though a gig would have served her purpose just as well, or a horse--or her feet. Eleanor often described Lady Renable as frivolous and ostentatious, and it was not an inaccurate description. She was also Christine's friend.<br><br>And then it became obvious that the horses were slowing. The carriage wheels squeaked in protest. All three ladies looked up.<br><br>"I do believe," Eleanor said, peering out the window over her spectacles again, "Lady Renable must be coming here. To what do we owe the honor, I wonder. Were you expecting her, Christine?"<br><br>"I knew I should have changed my cap after luncheon," their mother said. "Send Mrs. Skinner running upstairs for a clean one if you will, Christine."<br><br>"The one you are wearing is quite becoming enough, Mama," Christine assured her, finishing the flower arrangement quickly and crossing the room to kiss her mother's forehead. "It is only Melanie."<br><br>"Of course it is only Lady Renable. That is the whole point," her mother said, exasperated. But she did not renew her plea for a different cap to be sent for.<br><br>It did not take a genius to guess why Melanie was coming here either.<br><br>"I daresay she is coming to ask why you refused her invitation," Eleanor said, echoing her thought. "And I daresay she will not take no for an answer now that she has come in person. Poor Christine. Do you want to run up to your room and have me tell her that you seem to have come down with a touch of smallpox?"<br><br>Christine laughed while their mother threw up her hands in horror.<br><br>Indeed Melanie was not famed for taking no for an answer. Whatever Christine was doing, and she was almost always busy with something--teaching at the village school several times a week, visiting and helping the elderly and infirm or a new mother or a sick child or a friend, calling at the vicarage to amuse and play with the children, since in her estimation Charles and her sister Hazel neglected them altogether too much with the excuse that children did not need adults to play with them when they had one another--no matter what Christine was doing, Melanie always chose to believe that she must be simply languishing in the hope that someone would appear with a frivolous diversion.<br><br>Of course, Melanie was a friend, and Christine really did enjoy spending time with her--and with her children. But there were limits. She surely was coming here to renew in person the invitation that a servant had brought in writing yesterday. Christine had written back with a tactfully worded but firm refusal. Indeed, she had refused just as firmly a whole month ago when first asked.<br><br>The carriage drew to a halt before the garden gate with a great deal of noise and fuss, doubtless drawing the attention of every villager to the fact that the baroness was condescending to call upon Mrs. Thompson and her daughters at Hyacinth Cottage. There were the sounds of opening doors and slamming doors, and then someone--probably the coachman, since it certainly would not be Melanie herself--knocked imperiously on the house door.<br><br>Christine sighed and seated herself at the table, her mother put away her embroidery and adjusted her cap, and Eleanor, with a smirk, looked down at her book.<br><br>A few moments later Melanie, Lady Renable, swept into the room past Mrs. Skinner, the housekeeper, who had opened the door to announce her. She was, as usual, dressed absurdly for the country. She looked as elaborately turned out as if she were planning a promenade in Hyde Park in London. Bright plumes waved high above the large, stiff poke of her bonnet, giving the illusion of height. A lorgnette was clutched in one of her gloved hands. She seemed to half fill the room.<br><br>Christine smiled at her with amused affection.<br><br>"Ah, there you are, Christine," she said grandly after inclining her head graciously to the other ladies and asking how they did.<br><br>"Here I am," Christine agreed. "How do you do, Melanie? Do take the chair across from Mama's."<br><br>But her ladyship waved away the invitation with her lorgnette.<br><br>"I have not a moment to spare," she said. "I do not doubt I will bring on one of my migraines before the day is over. I regret that you have made this visit necessary, Christine. My written invitation ought to have sufficed, you know. I cannot imagine why you wrote back with a refusal. Bertie believes you are being coy and declares that it would serve you right if I did not come in person to persuade you. He often says ridiculous things. I know why you refused, and I have come here to tell you that you are sometimes ridiculous too. It is because Basil and Hermione are coming, is it not, and for some reason you quarreled with them after Oscar died. But that was a long time ago, and you have as much right to come as they do. Oscar was, after all, Basil's brother, and though he is gone, poor man, you are still and always will be connected by marriage to our family. Christine, you must not be stubborn. Or modest. You must remember that you are the widow of a viscount's brother."<br><br>Christine was not likely to forget, though sometimes she wished she could. She had been married for seven years to Oscar Derrick, brother of Basil, Viscount Elrick, and cousin of Lady Renable. They had met at Schofield Park at the very first house party Melanie hosted there after her marriage to Bertie, Baron Renable. It had been a brilliant match for Christine, the daughter of a gentleman of such slender means that he had been obliged to augment his income by becoming the village schoolmaster.<br><br>Now Melanie wanted her friend to attend another of her house parties.<br><br>"It is truly kind of you to ask me," Christine said. "But I would really rather not come, you know."<br><br>"Nonsense!" Melanie raised the lorgnette to her eyes and looked about the room with it, an affectation that always amused both Christine and Eleanor, who dipped her head behind her book now to hide her smile. "Of course you want to come. Whoever would not? Mama will be there with Audrey and Sir Lewis Wiseman--the party is in honor of their betrothal, though it has, of course, already been announced. Even Hector has been talked into coming, though you know he can never be persuaded to enjoy himself unless one of us forces him into it."<br><br>"And Justin too?" Christine asked. Audrey was Melanie's young sister, Hector and Justin, her brothers. Justin had been Christine's friend since their first acquaintance at that long-ago house party--almost her only friend, it had seemed during the last few years of her marriage.<br><br>"Of course Justin is coming too," Melanie said. "Does he not go everywhere--and does he not spend more time with me than with anyone else? You have always got along famously with my family. But even apart from them, we are expecting a large crowd of distinguished, agreeable guests, and we have any number of pleasurable activities planned for everyone's amusement, morning, noon, and night. You must come. I absolutely insist upon it."<br><br>"Oh, Melanie," Christine began, "I would really--"<br><br>"You ought to go, Christine," her mother urged her, "and enjoy yourself.

This dark fantasy tale is unlike Clive Barker's other recent ones: it is more tightly plotted, and more of <i>this</i> world. In a sequence of well-executed stories within stories (comparable to Russian dolls), Barker unfolds a compelling examination of what it means to be human, to be a man, and to be a gay man--on a planet where aging, disease, and death bring "the passing of things, of days and beasts and men he'd loved." A satisfying long novel packed with vivid images, memorable characters, and a melancholy mood that reaches for hope.<i>Sacrament</i>&nbsp; is a novel unlike any that Clive Barker has written. Neither horror nor fantasy, though partaking of both, this masterful work plunges far deeper and soars even higher. <p> It is the story of Will Rabjohns, perhaps the most famous wildlife photographer in the world, who has made his reputation chronicling the fates of endangered species, including his own. For even as Will rises to the pinnacle of his career, he is witnessing his own world -- the close-knit San Francisco community that has nurtured and liberated him -- ravaged by AIDS. </p><p> Then an almost mystical encounter with a bear in the Arctic leaves Will all but dead. In the depths of his coma, he revisits the wildernesses of his youth in England and relives the terrifying encounter that created him, both as an artist and a man. </p><p> Befriended by a mysterious couple, Rosa McGee and Jacob Steep, the young Will is granted the love he has been denied by his own family. But with that love comes a grim education. For while Rosa shows him the cruelties of passion, Jacob teaches him the purities of death -- seducing him with the possibility that he might one day slaughter the last of a species and thus change the world forever. </p><p> When Will stirs from his long sleep, he realizes that this dark dream, which he thought he had put behind him is still very much a part of who he is. Haunted by its echoes and driven by the certainty that he must face Rosa and Jacob one final time, he sets out on a journey of self-discovery -- a journey that will lead him from the familiar streets of San Francisco, back to the Yorkshire moors and on to the stark beauty of Scotland's Western Isles. There he will penetrate the ultimate mystery -- <i>The Domus Mundi</i> -- and finally discover the secret that links his destiny to that of the innumerable creatures with whom we share our planet. </p><p> <i>Sacrament</i>&nbsp; is the book Clive Barker's millions of readers knew he had to write someday: the troubling and passionate masterwork from the pen of one of today's most acclaimed authors.</p></p><h2>Cry Wolf</h2><p>Jake Barton, a tough engineer from Texas, Gareth Swales, a stylish English gunrunner, and Vicky Chambers, a pro-Ethiopian American journalist, become caught in a troubling triangle and in Ethiopia&#39;s struggle against Mussolini&#39;s invading armies</p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettesWilbur Smith was born in Central Africa in 1933.

These eight inspiring vignettes weave history, theology, and fictional detail into their biblical accounts to bring relief and a new perspective to those whose faith feels unremarkable. Written to encourage and relieve discouraged Christians who wonder if their faith is a disappointment to God, this book will demonstrate that remarkable faith-the kind Jesus marveled about-isn't about achieving or performing. Readers will discover they can exchange their performance-based evaluation of their faith with a fresh, life-giving intimacy with the Jesus who delights in transforming inadequacies into irrepressible affection. <br><br><b></b></p><p>Shauna Letellier (pronounced let'ler) has written for the Huffington Post, Day Spring's (in)courage blog, and <i>MomSense</i> Magazine (now called <i>Hello Dearest)</i>, a publication of MOPS International.

But, as Theda Skocpol shows in this startlingly new historical analysis, the United States actually pioneered generous social spending for many of its elderly, disabled, and dependent citizens. During the late nineteenth century, competitive party politics in American democracy led to the rapid expansion of benefits for Union Civil War veterans and their families.</p><p>Some Americans hoped to expand veterans' benefits into pensions for all of the needy elderly and social insurance for workingmen and their families. But such hopes went against the logic of political reform in the Progressive Era. Generous social spending faded along with the Civil War generation.</p><p>Instead, the nation nearly became a unique maternalist welfare state as the federal government and more than forty states enacted social spending, labor regulations, and health education programs to assist American mothers and children. Remarkably, as Skocpol shows, many of these policies were enacted even before American women were granted the right to vote. Banned from electoral politics, they turned their energies to creating huge, nation-spanning federations of local women's clubs, which collaborated with reform-minded professional women to spur legislative action across the country.</p><p>Blending original historical research with political analysis, Skocpol shows how governmental institutions, electoral rules, political parties, and earlier public policies combined to determine both the opportunities and the limits within which social policies were devised and changed by reformers and politically active social groups over the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p><p>By examining afresh the institutional, cultural, and organizational forces that have shaped U.S. social policies in the past, <i>Protecting Soldiers and Mothers</i> challenges us to think in new ways about what might be possible in the American future.</p></p><p>Theda Skocpol is Victor S.

Along the way he relates events of the journey to memories of his life, tying past and present together with a series of flashbacks that add depth and richness to the narrative. Sit in on intimate, probing conversations with the twentieth-century giants of faith he met along the way: Pope John XXIII, the Dalai Lama, Albert Schweitzer, D.T. Suzuki, and many others. Using his personal journey to the East to highlight the encounter between Christianity and the religions of the East, he explores the deep spiritual resonances between Buddhism and Christianity. The culmination of wisdom from a lifelong pilgrimage by the author of the classic book, The Zen of Seeing, this is an exciting journey with a guide who is wise, insightful, joyous, and full of hope. Franck&#39;s descriptions of his travels and his experiences along the way shine with the vividness only an artist could capture. If you are one of those restless spiritual pilgrims who feels the need to go beyond all formal religion and any single tradition, you would be wise to observe where Franck points in this gem of a book. Includes over 50 charming drawings which Franck sketched along the way.</p><p>Frederick Franck is an extraordinarily versatile polymath. During his life, which has spanned most of the twentieth century, he has been fortunate to have met, and even worked with, some of its spiritual giants. <p>Born in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in 1909, he studied medicine in his native country, graduated in dentistry in Belgium and acquired a degree from the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. He practiced privately in London, but spent his weekends with a group of Quakers working for the unemployed miners in Wales. In London, in the late 1930s, he began studying art seriously. </p><p>He came to America in 1939 and received his American degree from the University of Pittsburgh, where he taught Oral Surgery and Anesthesiology until 1944, when he went to Australia where he served as consultant with the then Netherlands Indies Government until the end of World War II. He returned to the United States, where he became a citizen in 1945. He practiced dentistry in New York City&#x2014;but for only two days a week. The rest of the time he wrote and painted in his studio on Bleecker Street, which according to legend, had once housed Edgar Allen Poe. He became successful as a painter and had regular one-man exhibitions in New York, Paris, and Amsterdam. </p><p>From 1958 to 1961 he served as oral surgeon on the medical staff of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambar�n�, Gabon, where he founded a dental and oral surgery clinic on behalf of MEDICO-CARE. His book, Days with Albert Schweitzer, was praised by The New York Times as &#x201c;the best book on Schweitzer to date&#x201d; and was translated into ten languages. </p><p>In 1963 he was awarded an Honary Doctorate in Fine Arts by the University of Pittsburgh. </p><p>On reading Pope John XXIII&#x2019;s opening speech to the Second Vatican Council, Franck felt it would be the spiritual watershed of the century. He flew to Rome and was the only artist to draw all four sessions from 1962 to 1965. About 80 of these drawings now belong to the St. Louis Priory, another 100 are in the collections of the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. Pope John XXIII awarded him a medal of appreciation for these drawings. It arrived as the radio was broadcasting the news of the pope&#x2019;s death. Franck flew to Rome to draw this &#x201c;genius of the heart&#x201d; one last time, on his bier. </p><p>In the late 1960s, Franck moved to the countryside to concentrate on his drawing, painting, sculpture, and writing. Today, he and his wife, Claske, live in Warwick, New York, where they have converted the ruins of an eighteenth century watermill into an &#x201c;oasis of peace and sanity&#x201d; called Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth). This transreligious sanctuary, with its gardens and numerous sculptures by Franck, is dedicated to Pope John XXIII, Albert Schweitzer, and the Japanese Buddhist sage Daisetz T. Suzuki. This quiet, non-sectarian, sacred space has been made available for Catholic, Protestant, Unitarian, Jewish, Buddhist, and Shinto services. Its exceptional acoustics make it ideal for chamber music and spiritual drama, which is frequently offered. </p><p>Franck&#x2019;s drawings and paintings are part of the permanent collections of a score of museums in America and abroad, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Fogg Museum, the Tokyo National Museum, as well as the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. Many of his sculptures are in public places in the United States and abroad. The Albert Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities exhibited his "Drawings of Lambar�n�: Albert Schweitzer&#x2019;s Hospital in Action," which toured the country. </p><p>His numerous books, listed in the front of this volume, deal with drawing as a mode of &#x201c;meditation in action,&#x201d; with his African and Asian experiences, and his consistent, experiential affirmation and personal commitment to the convergences of Eastern and Western spirituality, of which he may be recognized as a forerunner, long before it became an academic specialty. </p><p>Ever since he dictated his first book to Cl</p>Franck shows us a universal ecumenism that is rarely experienced.

Galbraith challenges why we worship work and productivity when so many of the goods we produce are superfluous, and why we grudge spending on public works while ignoring extravagance in the private sector. &#34;The Affluent Society&#34; exemplifies Galbraith&#39;s wit, clarity and eloquence of prose.</p><p>Conventional wisdom has it that John Kenneth Galbraith's <i>The Affluent Society</i> spawned the neoliberalism we see in Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and other world leaders. The economist's prose, lofty but still easily manageable, laid down the gauntlet for the post-cold war class struggle that was still far in the future in 1958. Galbraith saw the widening gap between the richest and the poorest as an emergent threat to economic stability, and proposed significant investment in parks, transportation, education, and other public amenities--what we now call infrastructure--to ameliorate these differences and postpone depression and revolution indefinitely. Widely criticized by conservatives and libertarians wary of public expenditures or increased government influence, Galbraith still influences liberal and neoliberal thinking. He has acknowledged that his work, like that of most social scientists, contains flaws (like his dire prediction of an out-of-control unemployment and inflation spiral that petered out in the 1980's), but much of it remains fresh and true even today. Four years before <i>Silent Spring</i>, he wrote about the consumerist blight that threatened our wild lands equally as much as our cities; his hoped-for increase in environmental awareness has grown significantly in recent years. Whether you support the political implementations of his views, experiencing his writing is important to put those views in context. More than this, though, it is an honest pleasure to read such original ideas so well expressed. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>John Kenneth Galbraith has written 30 books, spanning four decades. He has been awarded honorary degrees from Harvard, Oxford, the University of Paris and Moscow University. In 1998, he celebrated his 90th birthday. He continues to work as the Paul M Warburg Professor of Economics Emeritus at Harvard University.</p><h2>The Hand That Trembles: A Mystery (Ann Lindell Mysteries)</h2><p>&#x201c;Kjell Eriksson&#x2019;s crime novels are among the very best.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;</i>Henning Mankell&nbsp;A Swedish county commissioner walks out of a high-level meeting and disappears. Many years later, one of the town's natives is convinced that he's caught a glimpse of the missing man while traveling in Bangalore, India. When the rumors reach his hometown, a veteran police officer&nbsp;stumbles across a seemingly unrelated case. Ann Lindell, Eriksson's series detective, must investigate a severed female foot found where a striking number of inhabitants are single men. But the owner of the house where&nbsp;the victim&nbsp;believed to have lived is no longer able to answer any questions....</p><p>KJELL ERIKSSON is the author of the internationally acclaimed The Princess of Burundi, The Cruel Stars of the Night, and The Demon of Dakar. His series debut won Best First Novel 1999 by the Swedish Crime Academy, an accomplishment he later followed up by winning Best Swedish Crime Novel 2002 for The Princess of Burundi. <i>The Hand That Trembles</i> is his fourth novel in the series; he lives in Sweden.One<br>&nbsp;<br>It was at the corner of Brigade and Mahatma Ghandi Road that he had the first intuition. Not that he was superstitious, quite the opposite. Over the course of his career, rationality had been his trademark. It rendered him ill-suited to this country, and yet sympathetic to the Indian fatalism that he had grown to appreciate over the years. But he should have heeded the signs.<br>First this so unexpected thought of &#x201c;home&#x201d;: Whenever he thought of this word it was usually in conjunction with the apartment in Bangalore or, more rarely, the town house in Uppsala. But this time a vision of his Vaksala Square neighborhood rose before him. Of course he thought of his childhood street from time to time, but this time the recollection gripped him with unexpected force. He paused, was pushed aside, and came to a halt outside the entrance of a store that sold Kashmir silk.<br>There was nothing about MG Road that was reminiscent of Uppsala. Absolutely nothing. The intense, almost insane traffic, the eternal honking, and the cloud of exhaust fumes hovering over the street, all this was unthinkable around Vaksala Square. Almost everything he saw was unimaginable on Salagatan; the holes in the sidewalk, some so deep they seemed like portals to another world&#x2014;a darkness into which to descend. The stream of people, who adeptly veered to avoid the stopped man; the vendors of &#x201c;genuine&#x201d; Rolex watches and &#x201c;police glasses&#x201d; who avoided him with equal adeptness; the security guard from Guardwell posted outside the shop that promised excellent deals on shawls and saris but that in reality milked Westerners&#x2019; credit cards for a couple of thousand rupees extra. No eye-catching sums but enough to ensure that the Mafia from the north made handsome profits. At least that was what Lester said.<br>He saw the apartment building in which he grew up, the courtyard with the newly raked gravel of Fridays, the neatly edged lawns and plantings of roses and lilacs, the obligatory mock-orange bush and the unpleasant-smelling viburnum by the park down toward the railway tracks. An almost rigid order reigned over the landscaping around the buildings. An impression of immutability that he, at a brief visit many years later, could testify had lingered a surprising number of years. A utility building had been added, poorly placed and completely different in style; the gravel was no longer quite as attractively ridged; the flag post had been removed, perhaps temporarily; but the fundamentals remained, and the substantial lilac trees leaned thoughtfully, heavy with age and with twisted trunks as if they writhed in regret at the passing of time.<br>All this came before him as he stood on the pavement along MG Road. The guard looked more closely at him, perhaps nervous that the old man was about to collapse and thereby force him to engage.<br>Sven-Arne smiled reassuringly. The guard jerked his head but remained otherwise impassive.<br>Was it nostalgia? Could it be called that, although before this moment he could not have been able to imagine returning to Uppsala? But suddenly this dreamlike vision appeared, as when one imagines soaring like a bird or diving into the depths like a fish.<br>It was most likely the lack of possibility that caused his pain. He even lacked a valid passport. He took a couple of steps, mostly to escape the watchful eyes of the guard, stopped, then walked off in the direction of St. Marks Road.<br>The next warning came shortly thereafter.<br>After a few hundred meters, he saw a couple walking in his direction. He was immediately convinced that they were Swedes, even though there was nothing in their clothing or behavior that gave this impression. He walked toward the catastrophe without a thought of slipping into the alley he had just passed. He would have been able to get away, as he had done so many times before when he had had this premonition. But it was as if the learned defense mechanisms that had functioned so well for over a decade had now collapsed after the odd experience outside the silk store. He walked toward them, defenseless.<br>Their gazes met when they were ten or twenty meters from each other. The woman scrutinized him, her eyes going from his face to his strange clothing (in her opinion, most likely) and then she looked away with indifference. As they passed each other he heard her say a few words to her companion, a man around forty years of age. He was sweating in his suit and tie, one pace behind the woman.<br>She was speaking Swedish. Northwestern Sk�ne, maybe Helsingborg, he thought, always childishly pleased with his ability to place a person&#x2019;s dialect. &#x201c;I think we should ask Nils anyway.&#x201d; Her tone was decisive, almost aggressive. Sven-Arne had time to catch the man&#x2019;s unease. It was clear that he did not want to place a question to this Nils.<br>Just as they reached each other, the man glanced at Sven-Arne and for a moment the latter thought he saw a subtle shift in the man&#x2019;s facial expression, as if he recognized him, and Sven-Arne also caught an imperceptible reaction. The man slowed down slightly and lost even more ground to the woman. Was it just an unconscious reaction, an appeal, as if to say, &#x201c;Help me get away from this woman, distract her for a moment so that she&#x2019;ll drop the idea of talking to Nils&#x201d;?<br>Sven-Arne hurried on his way, without turning around.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The street noise grew louder the closer he got to St. Marks Road. A rickshaw had collided with a motorcycle, and two men were involved in a heated dispute. A woman standing next to the motorcyclist was crying. Blood trickled down her forehead. The rickshaw driver was screaming out his fury, saliva was spraying out of his mouth, and he was gesturing wildly to underscore his arguments.<br>The crash had blocked traffic and caused a serenade of honking, from the bellowing of the trucks to the ridiculous high-pitched signals from all the yellow rickshaws trying to maneuver their way through. Sven-Arne slowed down but did not stop. He had his inner crash to sort out.<br>Afterward, when he had caught his breath at Lester&#x2019;s, he cursed his own stupidity. He should have interpreted the signs better. Despite the evident warnings, he had continued along the street.<br>His goal had been Koshy&#x2019;s, where he returned to eat dinner once a year, for sentimental reasons. It was the only nostalgic act he allowed himself.<br>One evening in November 1993, disoriented and hungry after having vomited on the plane from Delhi, he had found himself standing outside the airport and had asked a taxi driver to take him to a good restaurant. That had been Koshy&#x2019;s.<br>Now he was going there to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of his arrival to the city that had become his home. It was, especially at first, an expression of self-torture, to test his own resolve.<br>The very first visit had not gone very well. He had burst into tears. Perhaps it was the exhaustion from the painful journey through Europe, the long flights and the extraordinary tribulations that caused him to collapse silently at the table. The waiter became aware of his distress and hurried over, but Sven-Arne waved him away, dried his tears, and opened the menu.<br>He was a stranger when he staggered out of the airport, and the sense of alienation had grown during the short ride into the city center. At his table at Koshy&#x2019;s he realized for the first time the enormity of his actions. Until this point he had been acting automatically without any thought of the consequences, from Uppsala to Arlanda airport, at Heathrow, at the terminal in Delhi. He had only one goal: to get away.<br>The yearly visit to the restaurant was therefore a test. He always sat at the same table. If it was occupied, he waited. Then he recalled in his mind the first experiences of Bangalore, the confusion and indecision, the uncertainty if he had done the right thing. Every year he came to the same conclusion: Yes, it had been the right thing to do. What other conclusion could he come to?<br>He stepped into Koshy&#x2019;s, relieved to escape the noise of the street and any possible new unsettling events. He went to the right, to the somewhat more exclusive part, pushed open the swinging door, and set his sights on the table, which was obscured both by a pillar and the maitre d&#x2019;. The latter had been the same for all these years, a broad-shouldered wrestling type whose hair was growing thin on top but who still had an imposing handlebar mustache, large hands, and a heavy-set, choleric face whose expression could nonetheless lighten at a moment&#x2019;s notice.<br>It came as a complete shock. Sven-Arne Persson turned on his heels and fled.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Kjell Eriksson<br>Translation � 2011 by Ebba Segerberg<br></p><h2>On Top of Spaghetti [Paperback]</h2><p>This is a wonderful story about spaghetti not only in story form, but also in music.

But now that she's made it out of the bloody arena alive, she's still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Who do they think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. And what's worse, President Snow has made it clear that no one else is safe either. Not Katniss's family, not her friends, not the people of District 12. Powerful and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Suzanne Collins's groundbreaking <i>The Hunger Games</i> trilogy promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year.<br> <br> <br> <p><b>A Q&amp;A with Suzanne Collins, Author of <i>Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)</i></b><br> </p><p></p> <b>Q:</b> You have said from the start that The Hunger Games story was intended as a trilogy. Did it actually end the way you planned it from the beginning? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Very much so. While I didn't know every detail, of course, the arc of the story from gladiator game, to revolution, to war, to the eventual outcome remained constant throughout the writing process. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> We understand you worked on the initial screenplay for a film to be based on <i>The Hunger Games</i>. What is the biggest difference between writing a novel and writing a screenplay?<p></p> <b>A:</b> There were several significant differences. Time, for starters. When you're adapting a novel into a two-hour movie you can't take everything with you. The story has to be condensed to fit the new form. Then there's the question of how best to take a book told in the first person and present tense and transform it into a satisfying dramatic experience. In the novel, you never leave Katniss for a second and are privy to all of her thoughts so you need a way to dramatize her inner world and to make it possible for other characters to exist outside of her company. Finally, there's the challenge of how to present the violence while still maintaining a PG-13 rating so that your core audience can view it. A lot of things are acceptable on a page that wouldn't be on a screen. But how certain moments are depicted will ultimately be in the director's hands. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> Are you able to consider future projects while working on <i>The Hunger Games</i>, or are you immersed in the world you are currently creating so fully that it is too difficult to think about new ideas?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I have a few seeds of ideas floating around in my head but--given that much of my focus is still on <i>The Hunger Games</i>--it will probably be awhile before one fully emerges and I can begin to develop it. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> The Hunger Games is an annual televised event in which one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts is forced to participate in a fight-to-the-death on live TV. What do you think the appeal of reality television is--to both kids and adults? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Well, they're often set up as games and, like sporting events, there's an interest in seeing who wins. The contestants are usually unknown, which makes them relatable. Sometimes they have very talented people performing. Then there's the voyeuristic thrill&#x2014;watching people being humiliated, or brought to tears, or suffering physically--which I find very disturbing. There's also the potential for desensitizing the audience, so that when they see real tragedy playing out on, say, the news, it doesn't have the impact it should.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> If you were forced to compete in the Hunger Games, what do you think your special skill would be? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Hiding. I'd be scaling those trees like Katniss and Rue. Since I was trained in sword-fighting, I guess my best hope would be to get hold of a rapier if there was one available. But the truth is I'd probably get about a four in Training.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What do you hope readers will come away with when they read The Hunger Games trilogy?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Questions about how elements of the books might be relevant in their own lives. And, if they're disturbing, what they might do about them. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> What were some of your favorite novels when you were a teen?<p></p> <b>A:</b> <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i> by Betty Smith <br> <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i> by Carson McCullers <br> <i>Nineteen Eighty Four</i> by George Orwell <br> <i>Anna Karenina</i> by Leo Tolstoy <br> <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut <br> <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> by Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle <br> <i>Lord of the Flies</i> by William Golding <br> <i>Boris</i> by Jaapter Haar <br> <i>Germinal</i> by Emile Zola <br> <i>Dandelion Wine</i> by Ray Bradbury <br> <p>(Photo � Cap Pryor)</p> <br> <br>Suzanne Collins&#39; debut novel, Gregor the Overlander, the first book in The Underland Chronicles, received wide praise both in the United States and abroad.

Merwin was born in New York City in 1927. He is the author of more than 15 books of poetry, including The River Sound (1999) and The Vixen(1996). He has been awarded most of the principal prizes in American poetry, including the Pulitzer Prize, the Bollinren Prize, and several books of prose, including The Lost Upland, his memoir of life in south of France.One of the finest senior U.S. poets stunningly evokes in prose the fabled romance and dark beauty of southwestern France. Seemingly channeling the troubadour spirit of the region, Merwin paints broad, but strikingly detailed, landscapes with his words, using language itself as a main character. He intermingles his personal experiences in the region with the songs of twelfth-century troubadours, illustrating superbly the flexibility of time in the historical cocoon of this ancient and endlessly resurrected locale. Often the prose sounds like poetry, and few other travel writings could aspire to the miraculously transporting quality of these crystalline sentences. The reader feels the restorative effects of this region and its poetry on Merwin, and cannot help but be touched. Like the songs of his troubadours, this little book soothes the soul while keeping the senses wide awake. <i>Will Hickman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Disappointment in one's earthly father, whether through death, absence, or mistreatment, frequently leads to a rejection of God. A biographical survey of influential atheists of the past four centuries shows that this "defective father hypothesis" provides a consistent explanation of the "intense atheism" of these thinkers. A survey of the leading intellectual defenders of Christianity over the same period confirms the hypothesis, finding few defective fathers. Professor Vitz concludes with an intriguing comparison of male and female atheists and a consideration of other psychological factors that can contribute to atheism. <p>Professor Vitz does not argue that atheism is psychologically determined. Each man, whatever his experiences, ultimately chooses to accept God or reject him. Yet the cavalier attribution of religious faith to irrational, psychological needs is so prevalent that an exposition of the psychological factors predisposing one to atheism is necessary.</p></p><p>PAUL C. VITZ, a professor of psychology at New York University, was an atheist until his late 30s. He earned his bachelor&#39;s degree at the University of Michigan and his Ph.D. at Stanford. Professor Vitz is the author of Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship, Modern Art and Modern Science, and Sigmund Freud&#39;s Christian Unconscious, as well as numerous articles in professional and popular journals. He and his wife, Evelyn Birge Vitz, also a professor at NYU, raised their six children in a faculty apartment in Greenwich Village.Vitz (psychology, New York U.), an atheist himself until his 30s, exposes atheism to the same psychological analysis atheistic apologists have used to debunk religious belief. Beginning with Freud's notion that belief in God is a product of humanity's desire for security, he argues that psychoanalysis is actually a better explanation for denial of God, concluding that the absence of a good father is at the core of militant atheism. Surveys of the leading intellectual defenders of atheism and Christianity, show that the atheists had "defective fathers" while the believers did not. Vitz does not intend to suggest that atheism is psychologically determined, but rather hopes to counteract the idea that irrational psychological factors lead one to believe in God. Annotation c.

Shrill ridicule and begrudging praise gave way to solid appreciation, triggered by comments such as this from Emile Zola: "His paintings speak whole volumes to me about energy and truth. . . . Here is a man among all these eunuchs." Novelist J. K. Huysmans found Monet's early canvases "sloppy" and "hasty," but the painter's friend, poet Stephane Mallarme, wrote, "I have never seen a boat poised more lightly on the water than in his pictures." Another supporter, Georges Clemenceau, praised the Water Lilies for daring to achieve the impossible. Critic Clement Greenberg defined Monet's enduring strength: "Impressionism was, and expressed, his innermost experience." Stuckey, curator at the National Gallery of Art, smoothly stitches together the commentaries to form a unique approach to understanding Monet. November 10<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.Stuckey, curator of 19th-century European painting at the National Gallery of Art, has carefully amassed and selected for this monumental volume the criticism of Monet written during the Impressionist master's lifetime plus two modern-day interpretations by William Seitz and Clement Greenberg. And what critiques! Annotations (really literary vignettes) identify each entry's author and set the stage for the commentary, from A. Wolff (1876)``outspokenly hostile''to G. Clemenceau (1929)``Monet's eye was nothing less than the whole man.'' The intent of the book is not to analyze but to present all aspects of Monet's long career. Interviews with the painter himself and references to the pertinent reproductions of his work complete the book. There are 122 fine full-color plates (including gatefolds) and a lengthy chronology.

Stefan Zweig's <i>Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman</i> is a dramatic account of the guillotine's most famous victim, from the time when as a fourteen-year-old she took Versailles by storm, to her frustrations with her aloof husband, her passionate love affair with the Swedish Count von Fersen, and ultimately to the chaos of the French Revolution and the savagery of the Terror. An impassioned narrative, Zweig's biography focuses on the human emotions of the participants and victims of the French Revolution, making it both an engrossingly compelling read and a sweeping and informative history.<br>"Certainly no one can arise unmoved from the reading of this powerful work." -- <i>The New Republic</i><br>"Excellent biography." -- <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>Stefan Zweig (born November 28, 1881, Vienna, Austria &#x2013; died February 22, 1942, Petr�polis, Brazil), was an Austrian novelist, playwright, journalist and biographer was one of the most successful and popular authors of the 20th Century. Although he wrote in German, his works were translated into English and several other languages. Zweig was a prolific writer. In the 1930s he was one of the most widely translated authors in the world. His extensive travels led him to India, Africa, North and Central America, and Russia. Zweig's friends included Maksim Gorky, Rainer Maria Rilke, Auguste Rodin, and Arturo Toscanini. Strangely, at the peak of his popularity and having just completed his autobiography while still working on four other books, Zweig committed suicide in Brazil with his new wife by them both taking poison. In 1939, he had married Charlotte Altmann, his secretary from 1933. She was twenty-seven years his junior. Zweig left a suicide note stating that he had done so because of the Nazi takeover of his country of Austria and because Europe was destroying itself with World War II that was taking place.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Divine Madman - The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa Kunley</h2><p>This is the &#34;&#34;secret biography&#34;&#34; of one of Tibets foremost saints, the Buddha Drukpa Kunley (1455-1570).

The genre they defined&#x2014;the Western&#x2014;and the heroic archetype they built still matter today.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> For more than twenty years John Ford and John Wayne were a blockbuster Hollywood team, turning out many of the finest Western films ever made. Ford, known for his black eye patch and for his hard-drinking, brawling masculinity, was a son of Irish immigrants and was renowned as a director for both his craftsmanship and his brutality. John &#x201c;Duke&#x201d; Wayne was a mere stagehand and bit player in &#x201c;B&#x201d; Westerns, but he was strapping and handsome, and Ford saw his potential. In 1939 Ford made Wayne a star in <i>Stagecoach</i>, and from there the two men established a close, often turbulent relationship.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their most productive years saw the release of one iconic film after another: <i>Rio Grande, The Quiet Man, The Searchers, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i>. But by 1960 the bond of their friendship had frayed, and Wayne felt he could move beyond his mentor with his first solo project, <i>The Alamo</i>. Few of Wayne&#x2019;s subsequent films would have the brilliance or the cachet of a John Ford Western, but viewed together the careers of these two men changed moviemaking in ways that endure to this day. Despite the decline of the Western in contemporary cinema, its cultural legacy, particularly the type of hero codified by Ford and Wayne&#x2014;tough, self-reliant, and unafraid to fight but also honorable, trustworthy, and kind&#x2014;resonates in everything from <i>Star Wars</i> to today&#x2019;s superhero franchises.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drawing on previously untapped caches of letters and personal documents, Nancy Schoenberger dramatically narrates a complicated, poignant, and iconic friendship and the lasting legacy of that friendship on American culture.</p><p>NANCY SCHOENBERGER is a professor of English and director of creative writing at the College of William and Mary.

The son of a bitch looked like a man."&#x2014;Raoul Walsh on John Wayne<br><br>"To live outside the law you must be honest."&#x2014;Bob Dylan<br><br>THE BIG BREAK<br><br>Director John Ford&#x2014;born John Martin Feeney and known as Sean O&#x2019;Fearna (in the Gaelic), Pappy, Coach, or Jack Ford&#x2014;elevated John Wayne from property boy, bit actor, and occasional stuntman to leading man in his classic 1939 film <i>Stagecoach,</i> launching the strapping actor on a career that would eventually make him the number one movie star in the world. But it wasn&#x2019;t Ford who gave John &#x201c;Duke&#x201d; Wayne his first starring role in pictures. It was Raoul Walsh, in a Western epic released in 1930 called <i>The Big Trail.</i> Wayne was well suited to play the new Adam, a frontiersman confronting an untamed, unspoiled wilderness with courage and optimism. He wore his essential goodness on his sleeve, and the characters around him often sought to exploit it. More significantly, the audience responded to it. In <i>The Big Trail,</i> he didn&#x2019;t need to wear the signature white hat, a staple of the early Hollywood Western for children, to show he was the good guy. His innocence, his courage, his resolve, his loyalty to a slain friend, and his tenderness to a feisty young woman on the wagon train he is guiding through the wilderness immediately signal a hero to root for. The fact that he has to be persuaded to take on the task also helps define him: the true hero is a reluctant hero.<br><br>That &#x201c;remarkable quality of innocence,&#x201d; as film director and film historian Peter Bogdanovich has noted, defined John Wayne right from the start and immediately made him a charismatic, and sympathetic, presence on-screen despite his lack of theatrical experience and film technique. His performance got Ford&#x2019;s attention and made him think that the handsome, well-mannered, oversized, somewhat shy property boy&#x2014;good mostly for moving scenery and occasional stunt work&#x2014;might turn out to be an actor after all. But it would take another nine years before Ford gave John Wayne a chance by casting him as the Ringo Kid in <i>Stagecoach</i>. When later asked why he waited so long before offering Wayne a leading role, Ford said that he had kept his eye on Duke all along but had waited because he felt that &#x201c;Duke wasn&#x2019;t ready. He had to develop his skills as an actor. . . . I wanted some pain written on his face to offset the innocence.&#x201d;<br><br>*<br><br>Marion Morrison&#x2019;s football coach at USC, Howard Jones, had gotten several of his athletes summer jobs moving scenery andprops at Fox and, later, working as extras in John Ford&#x2019;s Salute, about an Army-Navy football game at Annapolis. Morrison roundedup his fellow football players, including future sometime rival Ward Bond, who would become a memorable character actor and a reliable member of the John Ford Stock Company, as well as a longtime friend of both Ford&#x2019;s and Wayne&#x2019;s. But Ford first met Duke Morrison when Duke showed up to work on the Fox Studios lot in the summer of 1928, herding a flock of geese on the set of Ford&#x2019;s silent picture <i>Mother Machree</i>, a sentimental paean to Irish immigrants. The director was a tall, pipe-smoking, redheaded, heavy-featured man in spectacles who was surprisingly graceful on his feet. At thirty-three years of age, he would win his first Best Director Academy Award in 1936 for <i>The Informer,</i> a haunting, shadows-and-fog drama about a hapless man, played by the larger-than-life, barrel-chested Victor McLaglen, who informs against his friend in the Irish Republican Army. Ford had directed over sixty silent films by the time he met Duke&#x2014;learning everything he could from, and finally surpassing, his mentors: his older brother Frank Ford and the silent Western star Harry Carey&#x2014;and he had established a reputation as a crusty, quick-tempered Irishman inspiring fear and adoration in equal measure. Six feet tall and a former high school football player himself, Ford was not a man to be crossed. He took one look at the even larger&#x2014;six-foot-four, two-hundred-pound&#x2014;callow youth who stood off camera shyly corralling his flock of geese and instantly sized him up.<br><br>In romantic comedies, the hero and heroine &#x201c;meet cute&#x201d; and usually start out as adversaries. In male-bonding movies, the two buddies usually begin with a fight, testing each other&#x2019;s mettle, before becoming friends. So it happened with Ford and Wayne. Upon learning that Wayne was a USC football player, Ford tackled him to the ground. But Wayne got up and repositioned himself, taking Ford crashing down to the ground in one sudden move. The entire crew held its breath, waiting for the explosion of wrath. Surprisingly, it didn&#x2019;t come. Instead, Ford got up and calmly walked away. Duke&#x2014;still Marion Morrison&#x2014;had made an impression. Ford ended up casting Duke as an uncredited extra in <i>Mother Machree</i> and as an uncredited officer in another 1928 silent film, <i>Four Sons,</i> before returning him to the status of third assistant property man.<br><br>Years later, Ford recalled, "I met Duke&#x2014;he was very bright and energetic and I realized at the time he was hooked on movies. . . . I got him a job as third assistant prop man . . . [he&#x2019;s] the man who does the manual labor. And he was good; I remember one incident. I was doing a picture called <i>Four Sons</i> and there&#x2019;s a scene where a woman receives word about her son, it&#x2019;s a very dramatic scene. She&#x2019;s sitting alone in this room; in the back there&#x2019;s a big open door. We tried a couple of times, the third time she was great. In the back[ground] there&#x2019;s this big gangling Wayne sweeping the leaves off the floor; halfway through he looked in, gave a gasp of horror, dropped his broom and started running for the gate. . . . I said, that&#x2019;s a natural mistake, I know you&#x2019;re new to the business. Forget it! We&#x2019;ll dothe scene again and it&#x2019;ll be better. He was very chagrined."<br><br>Duke recalled, however, that he was dragged back to Ford, who &#x201c;bent me over and kicked me in the ass.&#x201d; Despite being embarrassed by his experiences on <i>Four Sons</i> and <i>Mother Machree,</i> Wayne developed a keen admiration of the director that would last his entire life. He recalled, &#x201c;I had no ambition to be an actor, I had no desire for it.&#x201d; What he wanted was &#x201c;to be like Jack Ford! My whole set up was that he was my mentor and my ideal! I think that deep down inside, he&#x2019;s one of the greatest human beings that I have ever known. And I&#x2019;ve known quite a few people in my life. And as a consequence I took more interest in the business.&#x201d;<br><br>By that time, his interest in pursuing a law career, his course of study at USC, had waned considerably. Wayne recalled that just being around Pappy Ford made him think seriously about his future: "When I went back to school that year, I looked around, and the kids that I knew who were going to take Law aroundthe time that I would be taking it, I&#x2019;d see one, and I&#x2019;d think, well his father has a law firm, another one, his uncle has one . . . and whether or not I&#x2019;m brighter, I&#x2019;ll end up writing their briefs for them! I&#x2019;ll be in the back room for ten years before I can even get started in the business, or else I&#x2019;ll have to hang up a shingle and take the kind of legal work I wouldn&#x2019;t be interested in. So for this reason, it really started preying on me."<br><br>It was just as well, because an injury derailed his football career and scholarship, and neither he nor his struggling family had the funds to cover his USC tuition.<br><br>Still not convinced that he wanted to be an actor, Duke realized he could make a contribution to Ford&#x2019;s movies beyond being a third assistant propman. He had the strength and athletic ability to do stunt work, and his opportunity came quickly on Ford&#x2019;s 1930 film <i>Men Without Women,</i> a tale of male camaraderie and danger that takes place entirely aboard a submarine, combining, incidentally, two of Ford&#x2019;s lifelong interests: the sea, and the fraternity of men living and working with other men, which would become a major theme in Ford&#x2019;s oeuvre. Duke Wayne recalled the challenge of doing stunt work on the picture: "We were between San Diego and Catalina, and I was up on the midship deck, and I had on a blue sweater and a watch cap. We were using a mine sweeper for a camera ship. . . . It was a gray day, and [Ford] was shooting into backlight, and two destroyers went by belching that black smoke, and it was just a beautiful scene. . . . There were big swells and steely gray water. . . . It was scary looking water. . . . [T]he navy boat is a big boat and they don&#x2019;t handle quite as easy."<br><br>Ford had reportedly promised Duke $75 for every dangerous stunt he performed, such as diving into those steely gray waters off Catalina, which he did repeatedly. But Ford never made good his offer; instead of the $450 he expected in addition to his salary of $35 per week, Duke was only given an additional $7.50 for risking his life. Duke later said, &#x201c;I should have complained . . . [but] I was still a shy, timid person, always embarrassed about speaking up for my rights.&#x201d; So any ambitions Wayne had for acting took second place behind his stunt work, until <i>The Big Trail</i> that same year.<br><br>*<br><br>Like John Ford, the director Raoul Walsh was the son of Irish immigrants from back east whose fifty-year career in Hollywood began as an actor and assistant director in silent films. His acting career ended after a freak road accident when a jackrabbit crashed into his windshield on location in Arizona, taking out his left eye. When the doctors offered him a glass eye, he turned it down, grousing that he&#x2019;d just lose it in a poker game and opting for a rakish black eye patch instead. Ford, plagued by weak eyesight, also adopted a black eye patch later in life&#x2014;possibly in imitation of Walsh&#x2014;which might have then influenced John Wayne&#x2019;s Academy Award&#x2013;winning role as Rooster Cogburn in Henry Hathaway&#x2019;s <i>True Grit.</i> Charles Portis&#x2019;s brilliant, comedic novel simply describes Cogburn as having an empty eye socket, unadorned by any eye patch, black or otherwise, suggesting that the touch was an homage of Wayne&#x2019;s devising.<br><br>The disfigurement ruled Walsh out of appearing in pictures but focused his mind on directing them. Also like Ford, Walsh was tough, prolific, and brilliant, directing sixty films including the classics<i> The Big Trail, High Sierra,</i> and <i>White Heat</i>. In 1929, Walsh set out to find a lead actor to replace studio favorite Gary Cooper, who wasn&#x2019;t available for <i>The Big Trail,</i> his ambitious, wide-screen Western epic. He happened to notice a strapping, fresh-faced, good-looking young man moving props at Fox Studios. He was struck by the youth&#x2019;s broad frame and the ease with which he carried an overstuffed chair hoisted lightly over one shoulder.<br><br>By the time Raoul Walsh laid eyes on Duke Morrison, the only on-screen experience Morrison had was as a bit player and stuntman in a handful of Ford&#x2019;s movies; his real value to the Ford Stock Company was still his brawn behind the scenes. When Walsh saw Morrison easily hoisting that chair above his head, he grasped the young man&#x2019;s potential, giving him a lead role in <i>The Big Trail</i> as Breck Coleman, a trapper out to avenge the murder of a friend who becomes a scout for a wagon train heading west on what would become the Oregon Trail. Walsh later recalled, &#x201c;He had a good height. He was bare breasted. It was a hot day. He wasn&#x2019;t wearing a shirt. He was a good looking boy. . . . He had a certain western hang to his shoulders. . . . [A] certain way of holding yourself and walking is typical of a real westerner and he had it.&#x201d; His youth and relative inexperience suited him well for the role of the reluctant hero who agrees to undertake the quest on behalf of his murdered friend, instead of seeking glory for himself.<br><br>It was Walsh, not Ford, who changed Marion Morrison&#x2019;s name to John Wayne, inspired in part by Revolutionary War hero &#x201c;Mad&#x201d; Anthony Wayne, though Duke apparently took the name &#x201c;John&#x201d; out of deference to John Ford, whom he hero-worshipped from the start. Many years later, when Ford&#x2019;s grandson, Dan Ford, asked him if Wayne borrowed the name from him, Ford answered, &#x201c;Yeah. He wanted a name sort of similar to mine. Which is flattering.&#x201d;<br><br>Because John Wayne reached his greatest fame as a mature, hardened, barrel-chested man with thinning hair, it&#x2019;s rather amazing to see him as the lithe, cheerful, and boyishly handsome twenty-three-year-old Breck Coleman in Walsh&#x2019;s epic. Dressed in buckskins and wearing moccasins, he embodies America&#x2019;s &#x201c;natural man,&#x201d; like Natty Bumppo in <i>The Last of the Mohicans,</i> or Huck Finn rafting down the Mississippi with the runaway slave Jim, or Davy Crockett in his iconic raccoon-tailed hat. Taught by Indians how to survive in the wilderness, Coleman even delivers a poetic soliloquy about the deep pleasures of sleeping in the open air under a radiant moon. He undertakes the arduous and dangerous journey not out of a need to prove himself or to seek glory but simply because he has to.<br><br>In his first major role, John Wayne played opposite a cast of seasoned stage actors, including Tyrone Power Sr., the beautiful Marguerite Churchill, and Ian Keith. Though he lacks technique and training, his naturalness on-screen outshines his fellow actors; the gracefulness of his large frame is already apparent, as are his effortless strength and, when called upon, a fierce resolve in his eyes. Yet he&#x2019;s also a sweet and playful lover; in an early scene, in one swift motion he lifts a would-be sweetheart off a piano bench, twirls her in the air, and catches her in his arms, planting a playful kiss on her lips. His grace and economy of motion&#x2014;his sheer joy of movement&#x2014;are a pleasure to watch. And because <i>The Big Trail</i> is a sweeping saga of America&#x2019;s western migration, filmed on location in stunning landscapes, John Wayne&#x2019;s persona as a great American hero&#x2014;indeed, an embodiment of America itself&#x2014;begins with Raoul Walsh&#x2019;s magnificent film.<br><br>Too bad it failed at the box office.<br><br>Fox&#x2019;s expensive investment in Grandeur CinemaScope techniques, which required refitting theaters with special equipment, and its steep production costs including two thousand extras, location shoots in four states, and a legion of horses, oxen, and Conestoga wagons, came close to bankrupting the studio. <i>The Big Trail</i> was the <i>Cleopatra</i>, the <i>Heaven&#x2019;s Gate</i>, of its day&#x2014;a financial disaster wreaked by the weight of its own ambition. After a memorable debut in a leading role, the newly christened John Wayne&#x2014;still known to his friends by his childhood nickname Duke&#x2014;failed to have his contract picked up by Fox, and he was relegated to appearing in B Westerns for Poverty Row studios like Mascot, Monogram, and Republic, mechanically churned out for the &#x201c;kiddie trade.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d hoped that his former mentor, John Ford, might use him in a real movie, for grown-ups, but that, so far, was not to be.<br><br>Ford didn&#x2019;t yet consider him leading role material. &#x201c;I like[d] Duke&#x2019;s style from the very first time I met him,&#x201d; he later said. &#x201c;I could see that here was a boy who was working for something&#x2014;not like most of the other guys, just hanging around to pick up a few fast bucks. Duke was really ambitious and willing to work.&#x201d; So Ford wasn&#x2019;t happy when Walsh poached Duke right from under his nose, and he was put out with Wayne for having defected, even if it meant a lead role in a major film. Ford considered it an act of betrayal. He had wanted to bring Wayne along slowly, and he felt the young man wasn&#x2019;t ready. So he refused to even speak to the hopeful actor for two years, though Duke tried to re-ingratiate himself. While he didn&#x2019;t blame Ford&#x2019;s cold shoulder on his appearing in <i>The Big Trail</i>, he did recall, "I remember he was evidently mad at me at one time . . . when I first started with him as an actor,...</p><h2>Off to Plymouth Rock</h2><p>Told with the whimsical verse of Dandi Mackall, children will love to hear the story of the Pilgrims&#39; voyage and the Native Americans&#39; guidance that culminated in the first Thanksgiving.

Now, with fuel supplies dwindling and fuel prices rapidly rising, it is time to reconsider the benefits of habitation below the earth&#39;s surface. This book of guidelines offers homeowners and architects a comfortable and economic approach to underground housing based on modern construction techniques. It provides plans, details and photographs of existing examples of earth sheltered houses from around the country, and shows how to design homes using such low cost natural resource and energy-saving systems as layers of soil insulation and passive solar heating. Many of the homes illustrate how the designs can be adapted to take advantage of specific natural surroundings. Avoiding the use of technical language whenever possible, the authors give clear-cut explanations of energy performance in earth sheltered homes, as well as helpful hints on selecting materials and equipment. The reader will find basic information on warm climate and cold climate designs, including detailed coverage of plans, site selection, waterproofing and insulation, as well as zoning codes and other public policy issues that relate to underground construction. Essential advice is given on systems which provide maximum protection from wind chill, unwanted infiltration, and direct heat loss. All the facts are here on creating a durable, low maintenance structure that is not only economical, but also as comfortable as a conventional home. Detailed appendices offer precise information on financing, building codes, and product information. Forward-looking homeowners, architects, and planners will value this comprehensive and timely study. The AA Journal calls it &#39;The first comprehensive underground design manual.&#39;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>In Search of Stones: A Pilgrimage of Faith, Reason, and Discovery</h2><p>The author of <em>In Heaven As on Earth</em> uses the occasion of a visit to the monoliths of Stonehenge to reflect on the spiritual, psychological, and philosophical truths that have shaped his life and formed his soul. Reprint.</p><p>The psychiatrist who has so successfully merged psychology and Christianity--his <i>Road Less Traveled</i> has spent 11 <i>years</i> on the <i>New York Times</i>' best-seller list--turns out to have a thing for megaliths, and so does his wife. Together, the couple roamed western Great Britain, from Wales to the Hebrides to Inverness, during May 31-June 20, 1992, looking for and at the mysterious standing stones (the most famous of them comprise Stonehenge, which the Pecks skipped), and Scott kept notes, which he greatly expanded upon for this book. There is a chapter for every day of the Pecks' journey, but they are not entitled with the days' destinations. Rather, they carry the names of the big topics--"Reason," "Romance," "Holiness," etc.--that the events of particular days made Peck contemplate, then or later. These topics elicit from Peck both the kind of rumination for which he is famous and wonderful little lessons in British religious history as well as the prehistory the megaliths bring to mind; for example, in "Religion," Peck relays the life and teachings of the original Quaker, George Fox (1624-91). Meanwhile, Peck also gives us some perfectly adequate travel writing about the actual trip. Maybe those who don't give a rip about megaliths will yawn during this excursion, but both Peck's faithful readership and those who adore all things British and ancient will be completely charmed. <i>Ray Olson</i>Peck, author of the phenomenal best seller The Road Less Travelled (1978) and a number of other respected books on personal growth, continues his journey with a thoroughly readable account of a vacation trip he and his wife took through Great Britain in search of megalithic stone monuments built by Neolithic people several thousand years ago. Peck and his wife are archaeology enthusiasts, and their quest for prehistoric standing stones takes them to many small towns and interesting out-of-the-way places. Against this backdrop, Peck interweaves philosophical musings and personal wisdom on a variety of subjects, including peace, parenthood, aging, religion, art, money, and death. He speaks openly and candidly of his own shortcomings as well as his triumphs, successes, and outlook on life. His search for ancient stone monuments leads to a deeper quest?an exploration of the mind and of one's own humanity. Peck masterfully integrates travel, archaeology, history, philosophy, and autobiography to provide useful insights into many of life's basic issues. This thoughtful work would be a valuable addition for all public libraries and is sure to be popular with those who are already familiar with Peck's writings.<br><i>- ?Elizabeth Salt, Otterbein Coll.

Fifty-year-old Nan, who's never worked, writes daily bulletins to excoriated husband Martin from the road, letting him know obliquely why she left by sharing secrets, including the fact that she feels continually diminished by his habitual lack of attention to what she says; that she's been going through a rough menopause, ``acutely missing my periods,'' and feeling like ``some old gal;'' that she fears the dark and hates that about herself; and that she wishes she and Martin could go live in a much smaller house by the ocean, with ``golden-colored wooden stairs and a small fieldstone fireplace,'' urging Martin to call an architect and have plans drawn up for such a house when she returns home. Talk about mixed messages. In her italicized diary entries, she remembers her past (pre-Martin boyfriends from the 1960s, the ways in which she tried to raise her now-grown daughter, Ruthie, ``to be different from me'') and chronicles her encounters with other loners (a teen-aged boy in an Ohio mall who wants to sleep with her; a humiliated wife in an Iowa garden-supply store; a bereaved young husband in a Minnesota motor park). She faces her fears (sleeps outside in the moonless dark, confronts her sexuality alone in a motel room one night) and gradually begins to miss Martin. So, finally, she heads back home to Boston, scripting her reunion with Martin in letters that contain not a shadow of a doubt that he wants her back. The culture doesn't want her back--she's idle, self-absorbed, and dull in ways we haven't encountered for 20 years. An uninspiring concoction. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There is a good index at the back and the contents are also clear. A few of the maps are complicated and require quite a bit of concentration to grasp. Another thing lacking is explanatory notes which would have really increased the usefulness of the map. Despite these, I believe the atlas should be part of the library of any school/college history deparment and any individual with an interest in world history.</p><p></p><h2>The Present Age: Progress and Anarchy in Modern America</h2><p>Reviews America&#39;s role in the world, focusing on a police-action foreign policy, an obsession with consumerism, and ever-rising personal debt</p><p>Robert Nisbet (1913-1996) was renowned worldwide for his scholarship in the history and philosophy of social and political thought. He taught at Columbia, the University of California at Berkeley, Smith College, and the University of Bologna.Nisbet, noted sociologist and conservative, argues that a revolution of ideas is needed in America. He deplores the country's moralizing international interventionism that Woodrow Wilsom made popular, because it has resulted in a "prevalence of war." He also criticizes the growth of the federal bureaucracy, which he regards as more absolutist than the divine-right monarchies. Nisbet blames the influence of Rousseau and disregard of Tocqueville for the centralization of power and attendant egalitarianism that he feels presently threaten individual liberty. He is further alarmed about the rampant greed and consumerism that he observes followed World War I. Though much of this is an update of ideas Nisbet has presented in previous works, it is recommended for public and academic libraries.

You get the idea. It's never too early to get your babies chewing on books and ruminating on the alphabet, and children of all ages enjoy the company of H.A. Rey's intrepid monkey, Curious George. In this board book, the letter itself mimics the shape of the animal or object in question. The A is actually the gaping jaw of the alligator, the B is the head and body of the big blue bird, and so on. In most of the pictures--not-so-curiously, 26 in all--youngsters will delight in finding a tiny Curious George, just about to get into mischief, no doubt. Adult Curious George fans will get a kick out of sharing their long-time monkey friend with their favorite little chimps, and preschoolers will enjoy the comical illustrations that offer just the right amount of detail to keep things interesting. (Baby to Preschool) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>Hans Augusto Rey was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1898. As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city&#39;s famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.</p><h2>Martha Stewart&#39;s Pies and Tarts</h2><p>Here are more than 100 original new recipes for tempting pies and tarts. <b>More than 160 full-color photographs.</b></p><p>e than 100 original new recipes for tempting pies and tarts. <b>More than 160 full-color photographs.</b>This is the third in Stewart's Food &amp; Entertaining series, following Entertaining and Hors d'Oeuvres, written in the informal, conversational style that attracts her readers and may assure them they can achieve the results displayed in Galton's photos. The author is a professional caterer and columnist for House Beautiful, and the elegant creations here bespeak learned skills, inventiveness and enthusiasm. Perfectly reproduced color pictures focus on pies, tarts and tartlets made from fruits (including the citrus types), berries, nuts, chocolate, vegetables. These ingredients are elaborately decorated, some baked in heart-shaped or other unconventional pans, most as rich as Croesus and a treat for the eyes as well as the palate. Stewart's instructions are complete, unmistakably clear and illustrated each step of the way. Still, a kitchen neophyte would probably be frustrated by attempts to make the Concord grape pie, garnished by a grape cluster, leaves and tendrilsall made of pastry; or a swirling, white-and-dark chocolate masterpiece surrounded by hand-fashioned chocolate leaves. The book is outstanding, and it should appeal strongly to people experienced in the art of fine cooking.

Maria is the founder of the Fitness without Borders, as well as the No Excuse Mom movement, an organization of thousands of women around the country making a commitment to their health one day at a time. Maria lives in California with her husband and three children.chapter 1<br><br>My Story<br><br>I �wasn&#x2019;t always fit. I never played a sport, and I grew up eating sugary cereals, boxed dinners, and fast food. I don&#x2019;t have superior genes, either. As the eldest of three daughters, my heavier frame always mimicked the bone structure of my overweight mother. While my mother was a charismatic, vibrant, and successful �businesswoman, she �didn&#x2019;t apply that same drive to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. She became a diabetic in her twenties, experienced strokes in her thirties, and had heart attacks and a kidney transplant in her forties.<br><br>Watching her suffer made me vigilant about protecting my health. At twelve years old, I purchased a cheap Reebok workout video by Gin Miller at my local store, and I used old phone books as my fitness stepper. I read the many diet books that my mother had around and began following a diet comprising foods with no fat, such as candy, breads, and pasta. After slowly gaining weight in my teens, I began to experiment with other diets. I attempted a juice �fast&#x2014;�that only lasted one day. I attempted the Atkins diet, but after three weeks of beef patties, bacon, and no bowel movement, I quit that, too. I tried diet pills and �weight-�loss shakes, with no success, either.<br><br>In college, I ecstatically became a �part-�time personal trainer and finally began learning how the body worked. I discovered strength training, integrated it into my workout routine, and was seeing incredible results. I learned how to master my metabolism by performing strength and cardio exercises, consuming balanced meals every three hours, and enjoying a splurge meal once a week. While it was difficult training, working, and studying all at the same time, I made it work because I was so conscious of the health risks that were inherent in my family. I was able to graduate in four years with a double major in history and international relations and a minor in political science from the University of California at Davis.<br><br>During my transition to work life, I decided to challenge my body and I started competing in local beauty and fitness competitions. For weeks, I would follow a strict diet of lean protein and complex carbohydrates, coupled with intense strength training and cardio exercise. I �wasn&#x2019;t eating enough calories for my activity level, though, and after each contest I would binge eat; I biologically and psychologically needed to refuel. I did win several contests locally and nationally, but I felt a void.<br><br>I was in my early twenties. I had graduated from college, moved to San Francisco, broken up with a �long-�term boyfriend, and changed occupations. I had built an �award-�winning physique and was even featured in national magazines. I should have felt happy, satisfied, and �accomplished&#x2014;�but I �didn&#x2019;t. I felt empty.<br><br>I felt like I �didn&#x2019;t know who I was and what motivated me to be independent, ambitious, competitive, and fit. In those reflective moments I could hear my mother&#x2019;s voice, cheering me on, supporting my efforts and celebrating the things I was able to do because she �couldn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Filling the Void<br><br>Up to this point, I thought that attaining objects, titles, and money would make me happy. But it �didn&#x2019;t. In fact, nothing did. I felt empty, so I began filling that emptiness with things that consoled me in the past. I started consuming cakes, cookies, chocolate, ice cream, and candy. While I ate upward of 3,000 calories per sitting, it seemed my body �didn&#x2019;t register my incredible intake because I never felt physically satiated. When guilt overtook my psyche, I forced myself to throw up. I would begin this destructive cycle of bingeing and purging up to three times a day, three or four times a week for several years. Dominated by thoughts of inadequacy, feeling spiritually vacant, and lacking control of thoughts, I found that people and events around me created intense anxiety. My weight crept back up to my early college days, and my �self-�esteem was declining quickly.<br><br>I remember going home one day and admitting my eating disorder to my mother. She confessed that she understood my personal plight intimately, as she also suffered from bulimia when she was younger. In a Twilight Zone moment, I felt that history was repeating �itself&#x2014;�after all, eating disorders leave a genetic stamp.<br><br>I saw the first twenty years of my life pass me by, and in an instant I grasped how every choice I had made was influenced by my mother&#x2019;s pushing me to become everything she �couldn&#x2019;t be (because she had married young, had multiple children, and was overweight). I realized that I �didn&#x2019;t have ownership of my decision to pursue extreme fitness and live independently and successfully in a big city.<br><br>My obsession to compete and win at all costs had been motivated by a desire to make my mother proud. She sacrificed her youth and her health in both raising us and working. She �didn&#x2019;t take time for herself; she �couldn&#x2019;t pursue a more fulfilling life because her health limited her. One night, I started writing a letter to my �mother&#x2014;�the woman for whom, beginning in fifth grade, I used to wake up each morning at 5 am so I could iron her clothes, cook her breakfast, and pack her a healthy lunch. Even then, I knew her busy life prevented her from making the healthiest choices, and I had grown up wanting to help her live a healthier life. I felt a piece of me shatter every time I saw her inject insulin, take prescription medications, or become briefly paralyzed from a minor stroke.<br><br>I �didn&#x2019;t want to become my mother, but whether I knew it or not, I already had.<br><br>Finding My Passion<br><br>My crazy eating led me to gain 30 pounds in one year. My clothes no longer fit, and the extra pounds weighed heavily on my nearly �5-�foot-�4-�inch frame. I started living in comfortable yoga pants, large skirts, and �empire-�waist dresses. I knew my body was metabolically damaged from years of disordered eating. It �didn&#x2019;t know when I would feed it, or if the food I consumed would remain there. I felt like my body was literally grabbing every calorie and saving it for a future famine.<br><br>In the depth of my personal pain I started to write, read, reflect, and pray. I began a personal website to document my innermost thoughts and initiated connections with people who empathized with my story of fear, guilt, shame, happiness, and triumph. I realized that I needed to let go of the past, to stop thinking of the future, and to start living in the present. If I consumed a cookie, I let it digest without negatively thinking of becoming fat or my feeling ashamed for lacking �self-�control. If I had an �out-�of-�control binge session, I �didn&#x2019;t beat myself up about it, and instead I determined to make more careful choices. I let go of my shame, reflected on what had caused the action, and held myself accountable for the consequences.<br><br>During this time I discovered similar stories of women who had been on �yo-�yo diets, taken �weight-�loss pills, and tried fasting, only to be left with bodies that �didn&#x2019;t trust their owners anymore. Our bodies �didn&#x2019;t feel loved, nurtured, or protected. We were treating our bodies like the enemy.<br><br>So I began the process of loving my body again. I nourished it with healthy, whole foods. I strengthened it through physical movement. I cared for it by giving it enough water, sleep, and rest. I reminded myself daily that however my body manifested through good nutrition and exercise, it was beautiful. So it manifested at 145 �pounds&#x2014;�20 pounds over my goal �weight&#x2014;�for many years. In one of those years, 2007, I met my future husband and I created my fitness nonprofit, Fitness Without Borders.<br><br>After years of battling the bulge, I had realized being healthy was important to me. I knew it could prevent �health-�related diseases like heart disease and diabetes, as well as improve the quality of my life. I saw these changes in other people, in the �low-�income places I worked, in the elderly people I served, and in the overweight groups I mentored. Fitness was a powerful, �life-�giving force that I genuinely had a passion for, yet like everyone else I still struggled daily with my personal excuses.<br><br>Whenever I was bored, anxious, or stressed, I binged on chocolate and chips. If I was depressed, I often skipped workouts and opted to lie in bed. Even when I began eating well and exercising consistently, my body was unresponsive. I told myself that my mother&#x2019;s genetics had finally caught up with me, that there was nothing I could do to lose those 20-plus pounds to get back into the shape that I loved. I resisted going on any diet because I knew it would trigger an eating disorder.<br><br>A part of me was settling down at my new weight, and I began believing this was as good as it would get. But part of me also knew that it was just an excuse. Deep within, I knew I could build my best body again if only I was willing to put in the effort.<br><br>In 2008, I found out I was pregnant, and I spiraled down into a state of depression for the majority of the pregnancy. Though my partner and I were engaged, we were unmarried. I had just quit my corporate job in San Francisco and moved home to Sacramento to help care for my mother, who was undergoing dialysis treatments for kidney failure. Not only was I fearful of our future together, but I was uncertain of what pregnancy would do to my �body&#x2014;�a body still struggling to lose those 20 pounds. Most mothers in my family had experienced weight gain, stretch marks, excess skin, swollen ankles, enlarged feet, and deflated �breasts&#x2014;�and many of those conditions �didn&#x2019;t go away after the babies were born. I was not too excited about my own pregnancy, therefore.<br><br>I wanted to maintain some feelings of control, so I began jour�naling my food intake and ensuring that I consumed only 500 additional calories per day. I maintained a light workout routine and I gained weight slowly. In those moments, I could almost feel my relationship with my body changing. Whereas before I had felt disconnected or at war with my physical form, now I was seeing it in a new light. I began revering my body for being the vessel containing this little miracle growing inside me. Wow, I could grow a human life!<br><br>By the end of my first pregnancy, in January 2009, I was 180 pounds and gave birth to a healthy �7-�pound, �14-�ounce baby boy. After his birth, I continued my healthy lifestyle by dropping my caloric intake slowly and adjusting my workout routine to match my son&#x2019;s sleeping and nursing schedule. Within six months I was down to 10 pounds below my �pre-�pregnancy weight! I was shocked to be in the 130s again, but not as shocked as I was when I discovered I was pregnant with baby number two.<br><br>This time, I �wasn&#x2019;t as anxious; I knew that it was possible for me to have a healthy baby and take care of myself at the same time. I began my pregnancy routine of managing my schedule, eating whole foods, splurging on occasion, and exercising one to three times a week. By the end of my second pregnancy in April 2010, I had gained 37 pounds and delivered in a �record-�breaking time of one hour after admission to the hospital.<br><br>My days were now busy with nursing my youngest son, attending to my eldest, and working as a business owner of small residential care facilities for the elderly. I knew I wanted to add one more child to our �fast-�growing family. By this time, David and I were married. We settled into my hometown of Elk Grove, California, and I was becoming a local leader as the founder of my fitness nonprofit Fitness without Borders; I also was leading a free &#x201c;mom fitness&#x201d; group. We welcomed our third son in December 2011.<br><br>Life was incredibly busy; I was �multitasking as a business owner, nonprofit director, freelance writer, and mother of three very young boys. Despite my daily obligations, I made it a priority to incorporate a workout routine that gave me energy and made me feel great. I was careful to take in enough food to keep my metabolism churning through the day. My weight loss was slow, but each week I was getting a little bit closer to my goal of feeling confident in a �midriff-�baring workout outfit.<br><br>Reaching a daily sweat was important for me because it was the only &#x201c;me time&#x201d; I had anymore. I looked forward to my workout session, whether it lasted 20 minutes or an entire hour! Exercising raised my �self-�esteem, increased my stamina, and lifted my spirits. I made a plan and set a deadline of six months to get back into great shape. I was doing something for myself, an action my mother inadvertently taught me to appreciate.<br><br>My �long-�term goal was to have a toned midsection, feel confident in a tank top, and weigh in at 125 pounds �again&#x2014;�a number I �hadn&#x2019;t seen for ten years. I raised the stakes by booking a professional photo shoot. To keep me motivated and stay the course, I created �short-�term, achievable goals that allowed me to feel successful. Six months after my doctor gave me clearance to exercise, I was brimming with pride. I set a goal, I followed a plan, I overcame adversities, and I followed through. I showed my husband a woman he&#x2019;d never seen before, and I proved to friends that it was possible to improve your body after having a child.<br><br>Above all, I was a good role model for my children. They saw me prioritize my health without sacrificing my work or family life, and they observed how energized and happy the exercise and good eating habits made me. Not only was I able to complete my fitness goals with a balanced approach, but I also got the body I wanted in a smart, healthy and sustainable way.<br><br>What&#x2019;s Your Excuse?<br><br>As I got ready to post my new photos to my website and Facebook page, I thought about what I wanted to say. I was proud of how I looked, and I was even more proud of all the work and commitment that had brought me to that point. I had vanquished a lot of personal demons to get to the healthy, happy relationship I now had with fitness and food. I once believed that it �wasn&#x2019;t possible for me to have a body I loved. I had thought that there was no way to avoid the health issues that plagued my mother. I had let fear stand between me and the healthy lifestyle I wanted. After my pregnancies, though, I had stopped letting all of those excuses get in my way. I had committed myself, one day at a time, to reach my goal, and one day at a time I had achieved that goal.</p><h2>Caravaggio: A Life</h2><p>Of all the great Italian painters, the seventeenth-century master Caravaggio speaks most clearly and powerfully to our time. In this vivid and beautifully written biography, Helen Langdon tells the story of the great painter&#39;s life and times in a way that leaves the reader with a renewed appreciation of his art.</p><p>Seventeenth-century painter Nicolas Poussin once said that Caravaggio came into the world to destroy painting. Helen Langdon's marvelous biography suggests that rather than destroying painting, the Milanese artist gave it a new lease on life. Upon his arrival in Rome, Caravaggio ended a tradition of Italian Renaissance painting with his radically new naturalistic style, which continues to dazzle and influence viewers today. Beautifully poised between biographical scholarship and artistic appreciation, Langdon's book provides the reader with a complex, fascinating portrait of Caravaggio, still the rebel and outsider of the popular imagination, but also immersed in the Roman world of art, politics, and patronage. Some of the finest sections of the book vividly evoke the streets and brothels of early 17th-century Rome, which provided Caravaggio with the inspiration for many of his early works. By contrast, the later sections--which deal with Caravaggio's exile and commissions in Naples, Malta, and Sicily--seem rather brief and truncated, giving the final third of the book a rather unbalanced feel. This is, however, partly due to the elusiveness of Caravaggio himself--with little direct contemporary documentation on the painter, he often slips into the shadows, evading the scrutiny of even the most persistent biographer. <p> Langdon's achievement here is to produce a compelling portrait of the artist that throws new light on his paintings. Here is a painter who was proud, difficult, and arrogant, yet highly intellectual in his appreciation of the changing face of both Catholicism and scientific enquiry. Written with great historical clarity, and supplemented by 42 magnificent color illustrations, Helen Langdon's <i>Caravaggio</i> is a worthy contribution to scholarly study of this artist. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i></p><b>Helen Langdon</b> has worked at the National Gallery, the British Museum, and the National Portrait Gallery.

In <em>The Jesus Papers</em>, Michael Baigent reveals the truth about Jesus's life and crucifixion. Despite&#x2014;or rather because of&#x2014;all the celebration and veneration that have surrounded the figure of Jesus for centuries, Baigent asserts that Jesus and the circumstances leading to his death have been heavily mythologized.</p><p>As a religious historian and a leading expert in the field of arcane knowledge, Baigent has unequaled access to hidden archives, secret societies, Masonic records, and the private collections of antiquities traders and their moneyed clients. Using that access to full advantage, Baigent explores the religious and political climate in which Jesus was born and raised, examining not only the conflicts between the Romans and the Jews, but the strife within the different factions of the Jewish Zealot movement. He chronicles the migrations of Jesus's family, his subsequent exposure to other cultures, and the events, teachings, and influences that were most likely to have shaped his early years. Baigent also uncovers the inconsistencies and biases in the accounts of the major historians of Jesus's time, including Josephus, Pliny, and Tacitus. The enduring influence of these accounts in forming our most common conceptions of Jesus reveals that spin is not a new phenomenon.</p><p>Taking us back to sites that over the last twenty years he has meticulously explored, studied, and in some instances excavated for the first time, Baigent provides a detailed account of his groundbreaking discoveries, including many never-before-seen photos. The evidence he has uncovered has lead him to make shocking new assertions that threaten the conventional account of Jesus's life and death and shake the very foundation of Western thought, based as it is upon the assumption of Jesus's divinity. Ultimately, his investigation raises the hope that we may gain a new understanding of Jesus.</p></p><p><p>Michael Baigent is the author of <em>From the Omens of Babylon</em>, <em>Ancient Traces</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Jesus Papers</em>.

The torching of European synagogues, suicide terror in Israel, the relentless comparison of the Israelis to Nazis, the paranoid post&#x2013;September 11 Internet-bred conspiracy theories, the Holocaust-denial literature spreading throughout the Arab world, the calumny and violence erupting on American college campuses: Suddenly, a new anti-Semitism has become widespread, even acceptable to some.<br><br> In this chilling and important new book, Ron Rosenbaum, author of the highly praised <i>Explaining Hitler,</i> brings together a collection of powerful essays about the origin and nature of the new anti-Semitism. Paul Berman, Marie Brenner, David Brooks, Harold Evans, Todd Gitlin, Jeffrey Goldberg, Bernard Lewis, David Mamet, Amos Oz, Cynthia Ozick, Frank Rich, Jonathan Rosen, Edward Said, Judith Shulevitz, Lawrence Summers, Jeffrey Toobin, and Robert Wistrich are among the distinguished writers and intellectuals who grapple with painful questions: Why now? What is&#x2014;or isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;new? Is a second Holocaust possible, this time in the Middle East? How does anti-Semitism differ from anti-Zionism?<br><br> These are issues too dangerous to ignore, too pressing to deny. <i>Those Who Forget the Past</i> is an essential volume for understanding the new bigotry of the twenty-first century.</p><p>Chapter 1<br><br>Jonathan Rosen<br><br>The Uncomfortable Question of Anti-Semitism<br><br>When i was growing up, my father would go to bed with a transistor radio set to an all-news station. Even without a radio, my father was attuned to the menace of history. A Jew born in Vienna in 1924, he Xed his homeland in 1938; his parents were killed in the Holocaust. I sometimes imagined my father was listening for some repetition of past evils so that he could rectify old responses, but he may just have been expecting more bad news. In any event, the grumbling static from the bedroom depressed me, and I vowed to replace it with music more cheerfully in tune with America. These days, however, I Wnd myself on my father&#x2019;s frequency. I have awakened to anti-Semitism.<br><br>I am not being chased down alleyways and called a Christ killer, I do not feel that prejudicial hiring practices will keep me out of a job, and I am not afraid that the police will come and take away my family. I am, in fact, more grateful than ever that my father found refuge in this country. But in recent weeks I have been reminded, in ways too plentiful to ignore, about the role Jews play in the fantasy life of the world. Jews were not the cause of World War II, but they were at the metaphysical center of that conXict nonetheless, since the Holocaust was part of Hitler&#x2019;s agenda and a key motivation of his campaign. Jews are not the cause of World War III, if that&#x2019;s what we are facing, but they have been placed at the center of it in mysterious and disturbing ways.<br><br>I was born in 1963, a generation removed and an ocean away from the destruction of European Jewry. My mother was born here, so there was always half the family that breathed in the easy air of postwar America. You don&#x2019;t have to read a lot of Freud to discover that the key to a healthy life is the ability to fend oV reality to a certain extent. Deny reality too much, of course, and you&#x2019;re crazy; too little and you&#x2019;re merely miserable. My own private balancing act has involved acknowledging the fate of my murdered grandparents and trying to live a modern American life. I studied English literature in college and in graduate school, where I toyed with a dissertation on Milton, a Christian concerned with justifying the ways of God to man. I dropped out of graduate school to become a writer, but I always felt about my life in America what Milton says of Adam and Eve entering exile&#x2014;the world was all before me.<br><br>Living in New York, pursuing my writing life, I had the world forever all before me. I chose within it&#x2014;I married and had a child. For ten years I worked at a Jewish newspaper. But my sense of endless American possibility never left me&#x2014;even working at a Jewish newspaper seemed a paradoxical assertion of American comfort. My father&#x2019;s refugee sense of the world was something that both informed me and that I worked to deWne myself against. I felt it was an act of mental health to recognize that his world was not my world and that his fears were the product of an experience alien to me. I was critical of the Holocaust Museum in Washington. I didn&#x2019;t want ancient European anti-Semitism enshrined on federal land. But now everything has come to American soil.<br><br>Recently, I read an interview with Sheik Muhammad Gemeaha&#x2014;who was not only the representative in the United States of the prominent Cairo Center of Islamic Learning, al-Azhar University, but also imam of the Islamic Cultural Center of New York City. The sheik, who until recently lived in Manhattan on the Upper West Side, explained that &#x201c;only the Jews&#x201d; were capable of destroying the World Trade Center and added that &#x201c;if it became known to the American people, they would have done to Jews what Hitler did.&#x201d; This sentiment will be familiar to anyone who has been watching the news or reading the papers. In Kuwait, there were reports that New York rabbis told their followers to take their money out of the stock market before September 11; in Egypt, the Mossad was blamed for the attack. It is easy talk to dismiss as madness, I suppose, but because so many millions of Muslims seem to believe it, and because airplanes actually did crash into the World Trade Center, words have a diVerent weight and menace than they had before.<br><br>So does history, or rather the forces that shape history&#x2014;particularly the history of the Jews. It would be wrong to say that everything changed on the eleventh of September for me. Like the man in the Hemingway novel who went bankrupt two ways&#x2014;gradually and then suddenly&#x2014;my awareness of things had also been growing slowly. My father&#x2019;s sister escaped in the 1930s from Vienna to Palestine&#x2014;now, of course, called Israel&#x2014;and I have a lot of family there. I grew up knowing that Israel, for all its vitality, was ringed with enemies; I knew how perilous and bleak life had become after the collapse of the Oslo peace process a year ago and how perilous and bleak it could be before that.<br><br>I knew, too, that works like &#x201c;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,&#x201d; the Russian forgery about demonic Jewish power, have been imported into Arab society, like obsolete but deadly Soviet weapons. By grafting ancient Christian calumnies onto modern political grievances, Arab governments have transformed Israel into an outpost of malevolent world Jewry, viewing Israelis and Jews as interchangeable emblems of cosmic evil. So when the Syrian defense minister recently told a delegation from the British Royal College of Defense Studies that the destruction of the World Trade Center was part of a Jewish conspiracy, I wasn&#x2019;t really surprised.<br><br>I&#x2019;d gotten a whiV of this back in early September, while following the United Nations conference on racism and discrimination in Durban, South Africa, where the Arab Lawyers Union distributed booklets at the conference containing anti-Semitic caricatures of Jews with fangs dripping blood&#x2014;a mere sideshow to the isolation of Israel and the equating of Zionism with racism that ultimately led to the United States&#x2019; withdrawal. Singling out Israel made of a modern nation an archetypal villain&#x2014;Jews were the problem and the countries of the world were Wguring out the solution. This was hardly new in the history of the United Nations, but there was something so naked about the resurrected Nazi propaganda and the anti-Semitism fueling the political denunciations that I felt kidnapped by history. The past had come calling.<br><br>I felt this in a diVerent form reading coverage of Israel in European papers. Though public expressions of anti-Semitism are taboo in a post-Holocaust world, many Europeans, in writing about Israel, have felt free to conjure images of determined child killers and mass murderers. Earlier this year, the Spanish daily La Vanguardia published a cartoon depicting a large building labeled &#x201c;Museum of the Jewish Holocaust&#x201d; and behind it a building under construction labeled &#x201c;Future Museum of the Palestinian Holocaust.&#x201d; The cartoon manages to demonize Jews and trivialize the Holocaust simultaneously. Tom Gross, an Israel-based journalist, recently pointed out to me that a BBC correspondent, Hilary Andersson, declared that to describe adequately the outrage of Israel&#x2019;s murder of Palestinian children one would have to reach back to Herod&#x2019;s slaughter of the innocents&#x2014;alluding to Herod&#x2019;s attempt to kill Christ in the cradle by massacring Jewish babies. After leading an editor from The Guardian on a tour of the occupied territories, Gross was astonished at the resulting front-page editorial in that highly inXuential British paper declaring that the establishment of Israel has exacted such a high moral price that &#x201c;the international community cannot support this cost indeWnitely.&#x201d;<br><br>I understood that the editorial, speaking of the cost of the establishment of Israel&#x2014;not of any particular policies&#x2014;implied that Israel&#x2019;s very right to exist is somehow still at issue. (One cannot imagine something similar being formulated about, say, Russia, in response to its battle with Chechen rebels, however much The Guardian might have disagreed with that country&#x2019;s policies.) And this reminded me inevitably of the situation of the Jews in 1940s Europe, where simply to be was an unpardonable crime.<br><br>I had somehow believed that the Jewish Question, which so obsessed both Jews and anti-Semites in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, had been solved&#x2014;most horribly by Hitler&#x2019;s &#x201c;Wnal solution,&#x201d; most hopefully by Zionism. But more and more I feel Jews being turned into a question mark once again. How is it, the world still asks&#x2014;about Israel, about Jews, about me&#x2014;that you are still here? I have always known that much of the world wanted Jews simply to disappear, but there are degrees of knowledge, and after September 11 my imagination seems more terribly able to imagine a world of rhetoric fulWlled.<br><br>There are Wve million Jews in Israel and eight million more Jews in the rest of the world. There are one billion Muslims. How has it happened that Israel and &#x201c;world Jewry,&#x201d; along with the United States, is the enemy of so many of them? To be singled out inside a singled-out country is doubly disconcerting. There are a lot of reasons why modernizing, secularizing, globalizing America, whose every decision has universal impact, would disturb large swaths of the world; we are, after all, a superpower. Surely it is stranger that Jews, by their mere presence in the world, would unleash such hysteria.<br><br>And yet what I kept hearing in those Wrst days in the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center is that it was our support of Israel that had somehow brought this devastation down on us. It was a kind of respectable variant of the belief that the Mossad had literally blown up the World Trade Center. It could of course be parried&#x2014;after all, the turning point in Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s hatred of the United States came during the Gulf war, when American troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia. But it had a lingering eVect; it was hard to avoid a certain feeling that there was something almost magical about Israel that made it toxic for friends and foes alike.<br><br>This feeling will not go away, if only because our support of that nation makes it harder to maintain our coalition. Israel has somehow become an obstacle to war and an obstacle to peace simultaneously.<br><br>Lately, of course, bin Laden has added treatment of Palestinians to his list of grievances, and this may revive the sense that Israel bears some measure of responsibility. Large lies can be constructed out of smaller truths. The occupation of the West Bank by Israel, though it grew out of a war Israel did not want, has been a nightmare for the Palestinians and a disaster for Israel morally, politically, and spiritually. It is a peculiar misery to feel this way and to feel, at the same time, that the situation has become a weapon in the war against Israel. Bin Laden would not want a Palestinian state on the West Bank, because he could not abide a Jewish state alongside it.<br><br>Neither could many of our allies in the Muslim world, who keep euphemistically suggesting that if only the &#x201c;Mideast crisis&#x201d; were resolved, terrorism would diminish. It has a plausible veneer&#x2014;and indeed, it would be an extraordinary achievement if the Palestinians got a homeland and Israel got safe borders. But since most of the players in the Middle East do not accept the existence of Israel, since &#x201c;solving the Mideast crisis&#x201d; would for them entail a modern version of Hitler&#x2019;s Wnal solution, the phrase takes on weird and even sinister overtones when it is blandly employed by well-intentioned governments calling for a speedy solution. And this Orwellian transformation of language is one of the most exasperating and disorienting aspects of the campaign against Israel. It has turned the word &#x201c;peace&#x201d; into a euphemism for war.<br><br>I grew up in a post-Holocaust world. For all the grim weight of that burden, and for all its echoing emptiness, there was a weird sort of safety in it too. After all, the worst thing had already happened&#x2014;everything else was aftermath. In the wake of the Holocaust, American anti-Semitism dissipated, the church expunged old calumnies. The horror had been suYcient to shock even countries like the Soviet Union into supporting a newly declared Jewish state. Israel after 1967 was a powerful nation&#x2014;besieged, but secure. American Jews were safe as houses.<br><br>I am not writing this essay to predict some inevitable calamity but to identify a change of mood. To say aloud that European anti-Semitism, which made the Holocaust possible, is still shaping the way Jews are perceived; Arab anti-Israel propaganda has joined hands with it and found a home in the embattled Muslim world. Something terrible has been born. What happened on September 11 is proof, as if we needed it, that people who threaten evil intend evil. This comes with the dawning awareness that weapons of mass destruction did not vanish with the Soviet Union; the knowledge that in fact they may pose a greater threat of actually being used in this century, if only in a limited fashion, is sinking in only now.<br><br>That a solution to one century&#x2019;s Jewish problem has become another century&#x2019;s Jewish problem is a cruel paradox. This tragedy has intensiWed to such a degree that friends, supporters of Israel, have wondered aloud to me if the time has come to acknowledge that the Israeli experiment has failed, that there is something in the enterprise itself that doomed it. This is the thinking of despair. I suppose one could wonder as much about America in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, since many American values will now be challenged and since, in Wghting a war, you always become a little like your enemy, if only in accepting the need to kill. I grew up at a time when sex education was considered essential but what might be called war education, what a country must do to survive, was looked upon with a kind of prudish horror. I suppose that will now change. In any event, Israel has been at war for Wfty years. Without that context, clear judgment is impossible, especially by those accustomed to the Holocaust notion that Jews in war are nothing but helpless victims&#x2014;a standard that can make images to the contrary seem aberrant.The growing concern about a global revival of anti-Semitism has been reflected in a number of new books, from Abraham H. Foxman's <i>Never Again?</i> to Phyllis Chesler's <i>The New Anti-Semitism</i> and Gabriel Schoenfeld's <i>The Return of Anti-Semitism</i>. All discuss the shift in geopolitical attitudes and events toward Jews and Israel since September 11; each also reflects its author's own political perspective. Rosenbaum's outstanding compilation of nearly 50 sharp essays has the advantage of not only displaying a wide range of views but juxtaposing pieces in debate with one another. Harvard president Lawrence Summers's critique of academic anti-Israeli sentiment, for instance, is answered by postmodern philosopher Judith Butler's pointing out the chilling effect of calling criticism of Israel "anti-Semitic." Rosenbaum (<i>Explaining Hitler</i>) focuses his collection on specific debates: three essays discuss the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, and another three discuss the controversy surrounding the alleged massacre by Israelis of Palestinians at Jenin. The selections are balanced�&#x20ac;"anti-Semitism and freedom of speech on college campuses, for instance, are discussed by Jeffrey Toobin, Todd Gitlin and Laurie Zoloth. Rosenbaum is also attuned to new aspects of old issues: "The Greatest Story Ever Sold" presents Frank Rich's thoughts on the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson's <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, while in "Who Did Kill Christ?" Nat Hentoff describes Christian rightists' ongoing promotion of the charge of deicide against the Jews. It's rare to find a book that includes essays by both Gabriel Schoenfeld and Edward Said, Ruth R. Wisse and Bernard Lewis. This is an estimable collection and may find a place with course adopters as well as common readers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In essence, these people are like anyone else - they have feelings and emotions that run deep. But they had an uncommon commitment: &#34;...they loved not their lives unto the death.&#34; (Revelation 12:11) How are they different from you and me? That depends on our level of commitment.

Growing up in working class, rural Wisconsin, Wicklund had her own painful abortion at a young age. It was not until she became a doctor that she realized how many women shared her ordeal of an unwanted pregnancy&#x2014;and how hidden this common experience remains.<p> This is the story of Susan's love for a profession that means listening to women and helping them through one of the most pivotal and controversial events in their lives. Hers is also a calling that means sleeping on planes and commuting between clinics in different states&#x2014;and that requires her to wear a bulletproof vest and to carry a .38 caliber revolver. This is also the story of the women whom Susan serves, women whose options are increasingly limited.</p><p> Through these intimate, complicated, and inspiring accounts, Wicklund reveals the truth about the women's clinics that anti-abortion activists portray as little more than slaughterhouses for the unborn. As we enter the most fevered political fight over abortion America has ever seen, this raw and powerful memoir shows us what is at stake.</p></p><p><b>Susan Wicklund</b> has worked in the field of women's reproductive health for more than twenty years. For much of that time she has been on the front lines of the abortion war, both as a doctor and as a spokeswoman for women's rights. She has been interviewed by numerous leading media outlets, including <i>60 Minutes</i> and "Fresh Air." <b>Alan Kesselheim</b> is a full-time freelance writer from Bozeman, Montana. <i>This Common Secret</i> is his ninth book.<p>Reviewed by Emily Bazelon</p><p>In the 35 years since Roe v. Wade, human stories and hard science have been the dueling weapons of the abortion wars. Abortion opponents have presented emotional accounts of the destruction of fetuses -- and, more recently, tales of distress from women who regret their abortions. Supporters of legal abortion have often countered with data on the decline in backstreet abortions and improvements in women's health and welfare. </p><p> So it's a welcome change to see two new books in which the pro-life and pro-choice camps switch their usual tactics. In This Common Secret, Susan Wicklund tells riveting stories about patients she has treated during nearly 20 years as an abortion provider. Meanwhile, in Embryo, Robert P. George and Christopher Tollefsen argue on scientific and philosophical grounds that from its first moment as a one-cell organism, the embryo is a living human being and, thus, entitled to legal protection. If Wicklund's book is the more effective, perhaps that's because she's not claiming to prove one objective truth, just conveying her own experience -- and because she has good, multifaceted stories to tell. </p><p>As a 26-year-old single mother working part-time and getting by on welfare and food stamps, Susan Wicklund became one of the first members of her large Wisconsin family to go to college. Before she decided to become a doctor and specialize in women's health, she had her own abortion to surmount -- a 1976 procedure that she did not understand, and that she sobbed and fought her way through until a doctor told her to shut up and drugged her. This horror story could come straight out of an anti-abortion pamphlet were it not for the determination Wicklund drew from it as she began medical school: "I could make sure my patients were treated differently than I had been -- with respect and decency. The memory of my own abortion troubled me, but it also hardened my resolve." </p><p>Such clear-eyed depictions of abortion services, and the close-up descriptions of the women Wicklund has treated, are the source of the book's power. This is a doctor who spent years working 100-hour weeks, crisscrossing the West to reach remote clinics and pregnant women. Over the years, Wicklund endured stalking and physical threats. She wore a bulletproof vest and carried a gun. One desperate morning in 1991, she woke to the sound of protesters chanting, "Susan kills babies!" outside her rural home. They stayed for weeks; Wicklund's daughter had to ride to school in a police car. And her marriage fell victim to the work and strain. "I have to recognize the truth," she writes. "My commitments have demanded a great deal from the people I love." </p><p>Her zeal is not for simple abortion on demand, but for medical care that ends in abortion only when both doctor and patient are sure of that choice. "My biggest fear has always been to do an abortion on someone who will later come to regret it," she writes. When she is afraid a woman is being coerced or has doubts, Wicklund says, she sends the woman away. In her book, Wicklund prints a grateful letter from one such patient. And she tells the story of a patient who opted for abortion because she'd thought she'd conceived through a rape, only to grieve inconsolably when she realized she'd mistaken the timing of her pregnancy. </p><p>These are not typical stories, and Wicklund does not present them as such. But she uses them to underscore the importance of counseling, which she describes as the biggest economic challenge of abortion practice, since it's hard to recoup the costs from insurers. And Wicklund's sensitivity to the fraught nature of abortion, as some women experience it, makes her stories of the damage wrought by the "antis," as she calls them, more credible and vivid. On the satisfied customer side of the ledger, she counts a prim woman who let loose a terrific scream of joy when assured she was no longer pregnant. And to illustrate the hassle of state-imposed restrictions, Wicklund describes a teenager who missed days of school and had to wait a month because of a state parental consent law, and a woman who lost her job because of the multiple visits necessitated by a mandated 24-hour waiting period. </p><p>George and Tollefsen's prose is dryer than Wicklund's because of the nature of their project. The authors -- George is a Princeton professor of jurisprudence and member of the President's Council on Bioethics, and Tollefsen a philosophy professor at the University of South Carolina -- set out to prove that "a human embryo is a whole living member of the species Homo sapiens in the earliest stage of his or her natural development." As such, from the moment of fertilization, the embryo deserves full moral respect as well as "the rights that people possess simply by virtue of their humanity." George and Tollefsen deliberately set aside religion in making their case, relying instead on the classic tools of philosophical proof. </p><p>The first steps of their argument are fairly unassailable -- sperm fertilizes egg, and a pencil-point-sized embryo, or zygote, is formed "fully programmed" to become a baby nine months later (assuming no missteps along the way). But can science or philosophy prove that this zygote has the same moral claim to legal status as any member of the "human family," such that the destruction of embryos in the service of stem cell research is akin to Nazi experiments on the mentally retarded? </p><p>The "living Homo sapiens" language that George and Tollefsen defend has been adopted by the legislature of South Dakota and is the subject of a legal challenge that may end up before the Supreme Court. The judges who have ruled in the case so far reject the notion that the status of the embryo can be objectively resolved by science. George and Tollefsen's book probably won't change their minds.</p><p>Here's an example that illustrates why. Harvard professor Michael Sandel, one of the authors' academic sparring partners, has posed this hypothetical: Suppose you're escaping from a building that's on fire, and you have to choose between saving a crate of frozen embryos and a 5-year-old girl -- which do you rescue? George and Tollefsen have to admit that most people would save the girl. But they insist that if the rescuer were the parent or grandparent of the embryos, he "might well choose to rescue them, and most people would not regard this as immoral." </p><p>Really? Is this an accurate representation of the moral stance of "most people," or a mirror that George and Tollefsen are holding up to themselves? Last fall, scientists in the United States and Japan announced they had reprogrammed adult cells to give them the qualities of embryonic cells that are so valued in stem cell research. This development takes the urgency out of George and Tollefsen's plea -- and most people would probably agree that if it leaves us with less to fight over in this arena, so much the better. But if science helps ease the embryo debate, it will be for reasons that these authors don't anticipate. </p><p></p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Your mother and my mother were practically sisters. Weren&#x2019;t you, Mama?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, we were.&#x201d; Elizabeth Hanover, the Countess of Hest, nodded. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m so pleased you began corresponding with Jane. You do look so like Eleanor, you know.&#x201d; She sighed, offering a soft smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome here, my dear, for as long as you care to stay. And of course I&#x2019;ll sponsor your Season. It&#x2019;s only fitting that you and Jane debut together.&#x201d; <br>Jane clapped her hands together. &#x201c;You see? You should have come down ages ago, Winnie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, I wanted to, believe you me. It&#x2019;s only Ran who dug in his heels about it. He thinks every Englishman is&#x2026;&#x201d; She trailed off, clearing her throat. &#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s very narrow-minded when it comes to London.&#x201d; <br>She flipped a hand, laughing, but to Charlotte&#x2019;s gaze young Lady Rowena didn&#x2019;t look entirely at ease. Of course she was fairly certain she wouldn&#x2019;t be, either, if she&#x2019;d traveled alone with no one but her maid through half of Scotland and nearly the entire length of England. Clearly Winnie had badly wanted a London Season. <br>For an overprotective brother, this Ranulf MacLawry had failed in rather spectacular fashion. A young lady who&#x2019;d never left her own shire had no business navigating England alone. Or of traveling in a mail coach. Charlotte had half a mind to write Lord Glengask and tell him precisely that. Surely no one could be so ignorant as to think it unnecessary even to send a letter to precede his sister to ensure that someone would be home to greet her and to take her in for the Season. It was&nbsp;&#x2026; it was unconscionable, even for someone ignorant of English custom. Surely he could read a newspaper, after all. And he must have a modicum of common sense. <br>She exchanged a glance with her father, who lifted an eyebrow before returning to the conversation. Jonathan Hanover, the Earl of Hest, was not a fan of chaos or upheaval of any kind, but he did dote on Jane and her to excess. Of course Lady Rowena would be welcomed into the house, and she would never see so much as a hint from him or anyone else that he would rather the family didn&#x2019;t have live-in company for the Season. <br>Longfellow, the butler, and two footmen arrived with cold sandwiches and tea for them; it was far past dinner, and evidently Mrs. Broomly had gone from the kitchen to spend the night with her very pregnant daughter near Tottenham Court. As the servants set out plates, the knocker at the front door rapped. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see to it, Longfellow,&#x201d; Charlotte said, since she was already standing and nearest the hallway door. <br>&#x201c;Thank you, milady.&#x201d; <br>By the time she&#x2019;d made her way the short distance from the sitting room to the foyer, the rapping had turned to pounding. &#x201c;For heaven&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; she muttered, and pulled open the door. &#x201c;What is so ur&#x2026;&#x201d; Charlotte began, then nearly swallowed her tongue. <br>A wall stood on the front portico. Well, perhaps he wasn&#x2019;t as wide as a wall, though his shoulders were certainly broad. But he towered over her by a good ten inches, and most of her fellows considered her tall. As all of that rattled nonsensically through her brain, though, what she most noticed were the blue, blue eyes currently glaring icily down his straight, perfectly carved nose at her. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here for Rowena MacLawry,&#x201d; he said without preamble, rich Highland Scot in his voice. <br>Charlotte blinked. Winnie, as Rowena had asked them to call her, had arrived less than an hour ago; taking a hack from the coaching inn. As far as she knew, no one else was aware of their visitor&#x2019;s presence in London. No one but Rowena&#x2019;s family, that was. They, however, remained in Scotland&#x2014;so far as she knew. <br>&#x201c;I didnae come all this way to be gaped at,&#x201d; the mountain stated into the short silence. &#x201c;Rowena MacLawry. Now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was not gaping at you, sir,&#x201d; Charlotte retorted, though she was quite aware that she didn&#x2019;t seem to be able to look away from that fierce, stunning countenance. It was if a black-haired god of war had simply&nbsp;&#x2026; appeared on her doorstep. &#x201c;Most visitors come to the door with a calling card, or at least with a word or two of polite greeting and introduction before they expect to be allowed past the foyer.&#x201d; <br>His eyes narrowed. It wasn&#x2019;t ice she saw in that deep blue, Charlotte realized, but something much more heated and angry. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m nae a visitor,&#x201d; he said, steel beneath the soft lilt. &#x201c;And if the English think a wee lass barring the door is enough to keep me from what&#x2019;s mine, they&#x2019;re madder than I recall.&#x201d; <br> <i>His?</i> This was becoming very strange, indeed. And there was no blasted need to be insulting. &#x201c;I am not a wee anyth&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>He stepped forward. Putting his large hands around her waist, he lifted her off her feet only to set her down behind him on the portico&#x2014;all before she could do anything more than take a gasping breath. By then he was well inside Hanover House. <br>&#x201c;Rowena!&#x201d; he bellowed, striding down the hallway. <br>Charlotte settled her skirts and charged after him. &#x201c;Stop that yelling at once!&#x201d; she ordered. <br>For all the attention he paid her stalking behind him, she might as well have been an insect. &#x201c;Rowena! I&#x2019;ll see yer arse here before me, or I&#x2019;ll knock this house down around yer blasted ears!&#x201d; <br>Longfellow and a trio of footmen dashed out of the sitting room. The big Scot pushed them aside as if they were no more than bowling pins. He shoved into the room they&#x2019;d exited, Charlotte on his booted heels. Given the physical&nbsp;&#x2026; presence he radiated, she expected to see Lady Rowena cowering behind a chair. Instead, however, the petite young lady stood in the middle of the room, her color high and her hands on her hips. <br>&#x201c;What the devil are ye doing here, Ranulf?&#x201d; she demanded. <br>&#x201c;The coach is outside. Ye have one minute to be inside it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ran, y&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fifty-five seconds.&#x201d; <br>Rowena seemed to deflate. As she lowered her head, a tear ran down one cheek. &#x201c;My things?&#x201d; she quavered. <br>&#x201c;What&nbsp;&#x2026; what is the meaning of this, and who the devil are you, sir?&#x201d; Lord Hest demanded. <br>The dark-haired head swiveled to pin the earl with a glare. The devil, indeed. &#x201c;Glengask.&#x201d; He returned his attention to Rowena. &#x201c;Go get Mitchell and yer things. If ye run in the meantime, we&#x2019;ll return to Glengask by way of St. Mary&#x2019;s, where I&#x2019;ll leave ye off. A decade or so with nuns should cool yer heels.&#x201d; <br>Another tear joined the first. &#x201c;Ye&#x2019;re a beast, Ranulf MacLawry,&#x201d; Winnie whispered, and fled past him and Charlotte out of the room. <br>&#x201c;Glengask. Lady Rowena&#x2019;s brother?&#x201d; her sister, Jane, said in a thready voice. &#x201c;The marquis?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; he returned, his tone still clipped and angry. <br>&#x201c;It was our understanding that you sent Lady Rowena to us for her Season,&#x201d; Charlotte&#x2019;s father stated. From his tight expression he was furious, and that didn&#x2019;t surprise her at all. People&#x2014;much less bellowing blue-eyed devil Scotsmen&#x2014;did not barge into proper households such as theirs unannounced. Ever. <br>&#x201c;Because ye wouldnae think twice over sending a young lass into a foreign land with no advance word. Or is it only a Scotsman ye&#x2019;d believe would do such a mad thing?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She told us you&#x2019;d sent her here,&#x201d; Charlotte put in. <br>The Marquis of Glengask turned around to face her. &#x201c;She told an idiot lie and ye believed it. Now get out of m&#x2019;way, lass, and we&#x2019;ll be gone from this damned place.&#x201d; <br>Rowena had called her brother a beast, and Charlotte saw nothing to contradict that assessment. And she did not like men who thought with their fists and large muscles. Not any more than she liked being called a lass and dismissed&#x2014;twice now&#x2014;as something no more significant than a flea. She squared her shoulders. &#x201c;I am Lady Charlotte Hanover, and you will address me properly, sir. Furthermore, until we are assured that your sister is safe in your company, she isn&#x2019;t going anywhere.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Charlotte!&#x201d; her mother hissed. <br>Yes, her family would more than likely simply be relieved to have this disruption gone from the house. But this was not the way anyone remotely civilized conducted business, or anything else. She refused to look away from his gaze, though he was clearly expecting her to do so. <br>&#x201c;Well then, Lady Charlotte,&#x201d; he said succinctly, exaggerating the roll of the <i>r</i> in her name, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose MacLawry family business is any of yers. I ordered my sister to remain at home, and she didnae. I am therefore here to bring her back where she belongs. As I&#x2019;ve clearly offended ye, I&#x2019;ll be waiting outside. Happily.&#x201d; <br>He took a step closer, lifting an artfully curved eyebrow as he did so. Obviously he was giving her the choice between stepping aside or being bodily lifted out of the way yet again. She elevated her chin to keep her gaze squarely on his. &#x201c;Your sister traveled a very great distance on her own and against your wishes, then, Lord Glengask. It seems to me that she wants very badly either to be in London, or to be away from you. I do not take you for someone who is crossed lightly.&#x201d; <br>The eyebrow dove with its twin into a scowl. &#x201c;It seems to me that this is still none of yer affair.&#x201d; He sent a glance at her father, who still stood in front of his chair and looked as though he&#x2019;d rather be in the House of Lords discussing taxes. &#x201c;Do ye allow yer women to speak for ye, then?&#x201d; <br>Lord Hest cleared his throat. &#x201c;My daughter is correct, Glengask. You&#x2019;ve stormed, clearly enraged, into a proper household and continue to behave like a bedlamite and a devil. It would be irresponsible of me to release Lady Rowena into your care without knowing her feelings and without some assurance of her well-being.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Her well-being&#x2019;?&#x201d; Glengask repeated darkly. &#x201c;How would ye respond, then, if Lady Charlotte here fled without a word and then when ye ran her down some foreign stranger refused to return her to ye?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Firstly, I would hope I never gave my daughter&#x2014;either of my daughters&#x2014;cause to flee her own home. And secondly, we are hardly foreign here. Nor are we precisely strangers, as your mother and my wife were the dearest of friends.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You somehow knew to come here to find Winnie,&#x201d; Charlotte added, before the marquis could begin an argument over the degree of their acquaintance. The man seemed to have an argument for everything, after all. &#x201c;Clearly we are not unknown to you. Nor you to us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ye&#x2019;ll have to keep me locked away forever and ever.&#x201d; Rowena&#x2019;s unsteady voice came from directly behind Charlotte. A moment later shaking fingers gripped hers. &#x201c;I only want to see London.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And so now ye&#x2019;ve seen it.&#x201d; Glengask looked from his sister to Charlotte to where their hands clutched together. &#x201c;Let my sister go,&#x201d; he said after a moment. <br>Charlotte tightened her grip. &#x201c;No. You are already in London. What possible harm could there be in allowing her to remain for a time?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;What possible&#x2026;&#x2019;&#x201d; He trailed off. &#x201c;I will not stand here and argue with a female over what&#x2019;s best for my own family,&#x201d; he finally growled. <br>She refused to flinch at his tone, though beside her, his sister did. &#x201c;Then as I am not giving in, I assume you mean to let Winnie remain here,&#x201d; she countered. Just when this young lady&#x2019;s cause had become hers, she had no idea. But this mountain of a man was not going to call her a wee lass and discount her. Not even if he&#x2019;d lifted her as if she weighed no more than a feather, and not even if he looked to be made of solid sinew and iron. <br>He opened his mouth, then snapped it shut again. Charlotte allowed herself a moment of satisfaction. So the English kitten had spat at the great Scottish bear, and he didn&#x2019;t know how to react. Good. And good for her. <br>&#x201c;So this is what ye aspire to, <i>piuthar</i>?&#x201d; he asked his sister a moment later, though his gaze remained disconcertingly steady on Charlotte. &#x201c;To surround yerself with Sasannach who keep ye from yer own family? To hide behind mouthy lasses who decide yer battles and fight them fer ye?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s making this a battle, Lord Glengask,&#x201d; Charlotte retorted, straightening her shoulders. &#x201c;And I am only &#x2018;mouthy,&#x2019; as you call it, in the face of an overbearing bully.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, my,&#x201d; Winnie whispered almost soundlessly, her fingers tightening. <br>A muscle in his lean, hard jaw jumped. &#x201c;A bully, am I?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That is certainly the impression you give. Your own sister is hiding behind a stranger rather than approach you.&#x201d; <br>The intense blue gaze shifted immediately to his sister. &#x201c;Rowena, ye know I&#x2026;&#x201d; He trailed off, then said a single word in Gaelic that didn&#x2019;t sound at all pleasant and that made his sister draw in a stiff breath through her nose. Finally he gave a slight nod, as if to himself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m nae a bully,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;One fortnight, Rowena. Ye want to see London, then see it. I&#x2019;ll take a house here, and ye&#x2019;ll have yer damned debut.&#x201d; He held out one hand. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go from here, then.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe ye, Ranulf.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I give ye my word. Two weeks.&#x201d; <br>Charlotte bit the inside of her cheek. He&#x2019;d just given far more ground than she expected, and she&#x2019;d likely pushed him far past where she should have, already. In addition, her parents wouldn&#x2019;t thank her for what she meant to say next&#x2014;but Rowena likely would. And this was for her new friend&#x2019;s sake rather than for her own. &#x201c;If you truly mean for your sister to have a proper Season&#x2014;or a fortnight&#x2019;s worth of one&#x2014;then she should remain here. You&#x2019;d be a bachelor household with no one to sponsor Lady Rowena or provide her with introductions. Unless you have a female relation here who&#x2019;s acquainted with London Society, that is.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have no female relations,&#x201d; Winnie said, her fingers tightening around Charlotte&#x2019;s hand again. &#x201c;And everything you do will be to show me how it&#x2019;s no good here. I only want to see it with my own eyes, Ran. Please.&#x201d; <br>He blew out his breath. &#x201c;By all rights I should take ye over my knee and have ye back on the road north within the hour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But ye won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he repeated after a moment, his glance finding Charlotte again. &#x201c;Stay here, then, if they&#x2019;ll have ye. But ye&#x2019;ll inform me where ye mean t&#x2019;be at all times, and I&#x2019;ll go about with ye when I choose.&#x201d; <br>With a squeak Rowena released Charlotte&#x2019;s hand and flung herself at her brother. He enveloped her in his muscular arms. &#x201c;I agree, Ran,&#x201d; she said fiercely. &#x201c;Thank ye. Thank you.&#x201d; <br>For a moment he closed his eyes, something close to relief&#x2014;or sadness&#x2014;briefly crossing his expression. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call on ye here in the morning. At eleven.&#x201d; Setting her down, he bent to kiss her on one cheek. &#x201c;Ye had me worried, <i>piuthar,</i>&#x201d; he murmured, then straightened again. &#x201c;Is there some nonsense ceremony aboot exiting, or may I take my leave?&#x201d; he asked, pinning Charlotte again with his gaze. <br>She stepped aside. &#x201c;Good evening, Lord Glengask.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Lady Charlotte.&#x201d; <br>Only when Longfellow had shut the front door rather firmly behind him did Charlotte let out the breath she&#x2019;d been holding. From the way her family swept up to her and the fast beating of her own heart, anyone would think she had just faced down the devil himself. But then she just had, really. <br>And he would be back in the morning. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;I do hope this is acceptable, Lord Glengask.&#x201d; <br>Ignoring the thin man dogging his heels, Ranulf continued his tour of the hallways and rooms of the small house on Adams Row...</p><h2>Baruch.</h2><p>This 337-page hardcover was published in 1957 by Holt (stated 5th printing).</p><p></p><h2>Valegro: Champion Horse</h2><p><ul> <li>Valegro is an Olympic champion horse, a World and European Gold Dressage champion, with a World #1 ranking</li> <li>This book is lavishly illustrated, combining never-before-seen images of Valegro's early days and at home with Carl Hester </li></ul>In an unprecedented career, Valegro has gone from rejection to leaving a trail of broken World records in his wake.From gangly youngster to 'the best the world has seen', this is the heart-warming story of the horse that revolutionized a centuries-old sport and won the hearts of equestrian and sports fans everywhere.

Committed lay Christians, says Cobb, are already theologians; he wants them to realize this and&nbsp;then to become good theologians. <p>Laypersons are just as capable as professional theologians of intellectual hard work, but they no longer expect the church to ask this of them. Cobb discusses why it is important for Christians to think about their own beliefs and assumptions. He encourages readers to find and become conversation partners. He also suggests steps a Christian's thinking may take; sources the individual can draw on, including how professionals can help; and where this thinking may lead. Cobb asserts that if there is a renewal of thinking in the church, there will be church renewal. The goal is to focus and sharpen one's thinking so that it is one's own, and to apply that thinking to one's being and acting. Each chapter ends with a section "Doing Your Theology" which is a list of questions for reflection and discussion. </p><p>Chapter titles include: On Becoming What You Are: A Theologian; Ethics and Theology; Shaping Up; Biblical Authority; Christians and Jews; Professionals: Help and Hindrance; Christian Counterattack; A Critique of Economics; A Critique of the University; An Afterword on Church Theology</p></p><p></p><h2>Miles from Where We Started: A Novel</h2><p><b>These no-longer-newlyweds want out of this road trip--and their marriage.

It first appeared in the famed "Summer of Love" of 1967, in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, and spread like wildfire in Southern California and beyond, to cities like Seattle, Atlanta, and Milwaukee. In 1971 the growing movement found its way into the national media spotlight and gained momentum, attracting a huge new following among evangelical church youth, who enthusiastically adopted the Jesus People persona as their own. Within a few years, however, the movement disappeared and was largely forgotten by everyone but those who had filled its ranks.<br><br><em>God's Forever Family</em> argues that the Jesus People movement was one of the most important American religious movements of the second half of the 20th-century. Not only do such new and burgeoning evangelical groups as Calvary Chapel and the Vineyard trace back to the Jesus People, but the movement paved the way for the huge Contemporary Christian Music industry and the rise of "Praise Music" in the nation's churches. More significantly, it revolutionized evangelicals' relationship with youth and popular culture. Larry Eskridge makes the case that the Jesus People movement not only helped create a resurgent evangelicalism but must be considered one of the formative powers that shaped American youth in the late 1960s and 1970s.<br></p><p><br><strong>Larry Eskridge </strong>was born in North Carolina and raised in the Chicago area, where he was involved with the Jesus People movement in the 1970s. A student of evangelicals' relationship to mass media and pop culture, he has been on the staff of the Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals at Wheaton College since 1988.<br><br>"[An] excellent new book...The book reads as an invaluable chronicle of an important moment in the history of American evangelicalism...This is an important, valuable, and engaging book that will certainly be the standard on the Jesus People movement for years to come."--<em>Church History</em> <br><p></p><br>"Larry Eskridge has written what will instantly become the standard account of the Jesus movement and its legacy...all scholars of recent American religion would do well to take a turn through <em>God's Forever Family.</em>"--<em>American Historical Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"This is an important contribution to our historical understanding of American (and global) Evangelicalism." --<em>Encounter</em> <br><p></p><br>"This book is the first serious, scholarly account of the Jesus Movement...We owe [Larry Eskridge] a debt of gratitude." --<em>The Gospel Coalition </em><br><p></p><br>"If you haven't yet checked out Larry Eskridge's <em>God's Forever Family: The Jesus People Movement in America</em>, you should move it to the top of your "to read" list right away. Beyond being beautifully written, the history (or histories) of the Jesus People it narrates should provoke some interesting questions for anyone interested in religion, culture, and politics in the twentieth century... Eskridge persuasively argues that despite the Jesus People movement's relatively short lifespan, it significantly changed evangelical culture in the long run. <em>But God's Forever Family</em> also gives us a much deeper look at the movement itself than previously available, and thus offers us an opportunity to consider it within the broader religious and cultural transformations of the period." --<em>Religion in American History</em> <br><p></p><br>"[A] painfully funny yet deadly serious study of the Jesus People, circa 1966 to 1976...The book presents a deft study of a timeless process of challenge and renewal in American Christianity." --<em>The Christian Century</em> <br><p></p><br>"It's extraordinary that it's taken this long for someone to write a comprehensively researched history and analysis of the Jesus People of the '60s and '70s...

Anyone who has background in the Christian counterculture, the 1970s charismatic renewal, or the Calvary Chapel, Vineyard, or Willow Creek church associations, will feel a sense of reading one s autobiography in this book. More broadly, the book is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the shape of contemporary evangelicalism." --<em>The Anxious Bench</em> <br><p></p><br>"This rich and surprisingly entertaining book is the definitive work on the Jesus People movement, a significant shaper of contemporary evangelicalism. Eskridge masters an incredible range of stories and sources. For anyone with a background in the Jesus People movement, Calvary Chapels, Vineyard churches, the Willow Creek Association, or the charismatic renewal that began in the 1970s, this is like reading an autobiography." --Thomas Kidd, Baylor University <br><p></p><br>"This long-awaited book tells one of the most important untold stories in postwar American religious life. One cannot understand the resurgence of American evangelical Christianity without taking into account the way the hippie Christians shaped its character and development. <em>God's Forever Family</em> is a splendid history. Both thoroughly researched and engaging, it will become the authoritative account of the Jesus People." --Tanya Marie Luhrmann, author of <em>When God Talks Back: Understanding the American Evangelical Relationship with God</em> <br><p></p><br>"Blossoming amidst the fads and frenzy of the youthful counterculture, the Jesus People blurred traditional boundaries between conservative religion and consumer popular culture. With clarity and insight, Larry Eskridge unearths the backstories and central dynamics of this curious phenomenon to show how it left a lasting mark on American evangelicalism. Solidly researched, <em>God's Forever Family</em> is sure to become the go-to text on the Jesus Movement." --William D. Romanowski, author of <em>Reforming Hollywood: How American Protestants Fought for Freedom at the Movies</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this substantial contribution to American social history, Eskridge [...] makes a cogent case for the continuing relevance of the youth-oriented Jesus movement that peaked in the 1970s, was largely neglected by scholars in subsequent decades, and is given definitive treatment here. Eskridge rightly credits the movement with changing attitudes of evangelicals from separatism to engagement in the world. Highly recommended." -G.R. Thursby, emeritus, University of Florida, <em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br>"Eskridge does an excellent job of offering a narrative of the late 1960s and 1970s jesus people Movements while inserting retrospective insights that position the vents in the wider socio-historical context of American culture and ecclesial responses to social change... This is an important contribution to our historical understanding of American (and global) Evangelicalism. It will serve as a sourcebook for years to come." --<em>Encounter</em> <br><p></p><br>"This well-researched and deftly written book will probably become the definitive history of the Jesus People movement, which caught the attention of the American public in the early 1970s." --<em>Religious Studies Review</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Sitting Bull and His World</h2><p>The author of Terror of the Spanish Main discusses the life of the Hunkpapa chief who is remembered for his defeat of General Custer at Little Big Horn.</p><p>Albert Marrin is a much-decorated historian and writer whose most recent book, <i>Terror of the Spanish Main</i>, was called "addictive reading" in <i>The Horn Book</i>.Grade 6 Up-An exploration of the life and times of one of the best-known Native American leaders of the 1800s. Marrin is respectful of and sympathetic toward his subject, while presenting an evenhanded and sensitive view of the social, economic, political, and military forces at play in the "conquest of the Great Plains." His style here is similar to Russell Freedman's in The Life &amp; Death of Crazy Horse (Holiday, 1996). A comprehensive work, the book covers Sitting Bull's brave accomplishments in his youth, his wisdom and influence as an adult, and his experiences later in life with Buffalo Bill, as well as his murder. Throughout, the author illuminates the culture of the Plains Indians with explanations and descriptions of spiritual beliefs, gender roles, and traditional chants and ceremonies. While this title is more readable than Elizabeth Schleichert's Sitting Bull (Enslow, 1997), it is also more challenging to get to the facts as the lengthy text contains so much background information and lacks a time line. However, the index is extensive, as are the chapter notes and bibliography. The volume is well illustrated with black-and-white photographs, reproductions, representations of drawings done by Sitting Bull for his pictorial autobiography, and helpful maps. This exceptionally well-documented work is an enjoyable read and a valuable resource that merits a place in all collections.<br><i>Andrew Medlar, Chicago Public Library, IL </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Judas Window</h2><p>Sir Henry Merrivale attempts to prove the innocence of James Answell, who was discovered inside a locked room with the body of Avery Hume</p><p></p><h2>Aalto</h2><p>Finnish architect Alvar Aalto (18981976) was not only influenced by the landscape of his native country, but by the political struggle over Finland&#39;s place within European culture.

He is the owner of Guy Savoy, a haute cuisine Parisian restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe, and several casual Parisian restaurants serving simpler fare-Au Butte Chaillot, Les Bookinistes, and L'Atelier de Ma�tre Albert. PATRICIA WELLS is the food editor of <i>The International Herald Tribune</i> and the author of several books, including the best-selling <i>Food Lover's Guide to Paris</i> and <i>Food Lover's Guide to France</i>. LAURENCE MOUTON has an impressive career as a food photographer and stylist for many of the most important French chefs. She has also photographed for many international cookbooks.Like fine cognac, Savoy's recipes distill the essence of French cooking into a deceptively simple package. The French approach is clearly evident on the table of contents, which divides more than 80 recipes into six chapters representing the traditional courses: appetizers (encompassing a variety of soups, salads and side dishes), gratins, fish, meat, cheese and desserts. Rather than simplifying haute cuisine's complex techniques, Savoy chooses dishes that can be well executed with the skills and equipment available to a nonprofessional with only a few years behind the stove. Home cooks can reliably obtain the down-home elegance of Sausage En Brioche, Mustard-Roasted Skate with Lentils, a basic Cheese Souffl�, and Poached Pears in Wine with Savoy's easy-to-follow instructions and straightforward ingredient lists. Novices overwhelmed by the litany of notes and cautions found in many French cookbooks may find their confidence bolstered by the direct approach here; on the other hand, they may feel flummoxed if their hollandaise doesn't quite come together as promised. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now a grown man and a renowned ornithologist, he has come back to visit his ailing mother and explain to her what drove his obsession with bird life. His explanation forms a series of interlocking tales from the frontier where the world of birds intersects with the world of the humans who pursue them. The stories range over settings from Alaska to Africa, from trackless jungles to parking lots. They delve into subjects from first dates to last rites, from imagination and desire to sleep deprivation, from poignant encounters with eternal mysteries to comical brushes with biker gangs and secret agents. But as the stories unfold, the ornithologist comes to realize that he can still learn from his mother some things about life and even about the meaning of birds.<br><br>Flights Against the Sunset brings together nineteen essays, mostly adapted from Kaufman's long-running column in Bird Watcher&#x2019;s Digest. They weave an original story that examines how we communicate about our passions with those who do not share the same interests and how to celebrate the world of infinite possibilities and wonder.</p><p>KENN KAUFMAN, originator of the Kaufman Field Guide series, is one of the world&#x2019;s foremost naturalists.Room 432 9:13 A.M.<br><br> I felt the same way,&#x201d; JB told me. It&#x2019;s awkward to talk about your trip halfway around the world when you know that she hasn&#x2019;t even been out in the hall for three months. But you know, she genuinely wants to hear it. All of it.&#x201d; My brother had just come back from a film-history conference in Europe. I had just come back from leading a group on a nature tour in South America. Down the corridor from where we stood, our mother, going nowhere except gradually downhill, was lying in bed in a square white room on the fourth floor of a care and rehabilitation facility in Wichita, Kansas.<br> I had just arrived in town. At the conclusion of my South American tour, I&#x2019;d gone home just long enough to clean up from the trip, and then I&#x2019;d flown here, rented a car, and come straight to the rehab center, just as I always did. It had been six weeks since my last visit, and I was lingering in the hall, talking to JB, who was just leaving, while I steeled my nerves for the emotion of seeing her. Mom loved all four of her sons and she had never played favorites, but my three brothers all lived here in Wichita and they came in multiple times every week. I was the one who lived a thousand miles away. When I came here it was a different kind of visit.<br> In just a moment I would go on into the room. She knew I was coming, we made a point of not taking her by surprise, so I knew how it would go. She would be sitting up as best she could, and smiling, putting on a brave face, still determined to take care of her sons in any way she could manage, even if it were only to hide the pain and pretend that she was feeling fine. I would smile, too, and try not to show my shock at the fact that she would look even thinner than last time, the lines of pain etched deeper into her face. We would both put on this pretense for all the best reasons as I walked into the room.<br> Someone, either a staff person or one of my sisters-in-law, had washed her hair and put a ribbon in it. Hello, beautiful,&#x201d; I said, kneeling next to the bed and hugging her as well as I could. Your hair looks nice.&#x201d; I kissed her on the forehead.<br> Oh, you,&#x201d; she said, the words slow and a little slurred. Don&#x2019;t you know . . . it&#x2019;s not nice to lie to your mother.&#x201d; Oh, of course!&#x201d; I said. I would never do that!&#x201d; She had been beautiful all her life, but my father had loved her for her character and spirit, not just her looks. My father had adored her until the night he died, a night that had arrived with ferocious abruptness just a couple of years before. Married at twenty, never on her own, my mother had struggled with the agony and sheer terror of being alone for almost a year, and then a stroke had nearly taken her away. She had been in a coma for three weeks while my brothers and I stood vigil at the intensive care unit, deflecting the polite inquiries from doctors about pulling the plug, and then she had opened her eyes and started to come back to us. Mentally she came almost all the way back, and in a couple of months it was obvious that she knew us, she knew everything, and only her body was wasted and half paralyzed. Her speech was pained and slow, but she still knew all the words and she would bravely struggle to make conversation with anyone who came to visit.<br> I had begun making regular visits to Wichita, every few weeks, to do what I could to be helpful. There were still things to be done at the house the house that we had moved into when I was nine, the house where Mom had lived with Dad for more than thirty years and I wanted to do my part to help out. We were all operating on the stated belief that Mom&#x2019;s recovery would continue, that she would get better and better, and eventually she would be able to go home again, so we kept up all the standard maintenance, down to the level of mowing the lawn and cleaning the windows and even filling the bird feeder. So I would come to town with the idea of working around that house, but first I would go to see Mom, and she would beg me to stay and talk. And I would. I would sit by her bed and we would talk about everything, everything I could possibly think of to keep the conversation going, to keep her mind off of the pain. We would talk for three days, and then she would fight back the tears when I left for the airport to fly back home.<br> So,&#x201d; I said, perching on the edge of a chair. Are you causing plenty of trouble?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m trying,&#x201d; she said. Doing my best.&#x201d; Keeping the staff awake at night with wild parties? Loud music, dancing girls? Although, I guess, dancing boys would be more like it.&#x201d; Dancing bears,&#x201d; she said. I&#x2019;m holding out for dancing bears.&#x201d; Good idea,&#x201d; I observed. Doesn&#x2019;t take as many of them to make an impression..&#x201d; They&#x2019;re . . . not easy to get,&#x201d; Mom said. Her speech was slow and halting, but she would persevere to finish a complete thought and to be understood. I could probably call and get a pizza delivered. But nobody will deliver dancing bears.&#x201d; Well, here&#x2019;s an idea. Here&#x2019;s a way to combine two needs. We could start a pizza company that delivers, but instead of having pimply-faced teenagers bring the pizza, we could have it delivered by dancing bears. All we have to do is find the dancing bears and teach them to drive.&#x201d; Mom gave me a long, doubtful look. I guess it&#x2019;s a business model that has never been tried. Maybe for good reason.&#x201d; I can see it now. Bearly Edible Pizza, Incorporated. Do you want to be CEO?&#x201d; If you got too close to the bears,&#x201d; she said, it would be C E Owww.&#x201d; We had always done this, she and my brothers and I, and sometimes my dad as well, we had always engaged in this kind of banter and wordplay. Mom&#x2019;s mind was still good enough for her to dream up interesting ideas and bad puns, and it was only physical strength that was lacking, making it hard for her to talk. But the strength of spirit was still there. She would act cheerful and as if everything was fine, hiding the discomfort that we knew she was feeling.<br> Was it Africa this time?&#x201d; she asked. No . . . no, you were in South America, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I said. Northern South America. Venezuela again. I&#x2019;ve been there a bunch of times now. I&#x2019;ll never know it like the U.S. or Mexico, but I feel like I&#x2019;m starting to get a handle on the birds there.&#x201d; Tell me about your trip,&#x201d; she said. I want to hear . . . all about it.&#x201d; I paused before answering, and in that moment it occurred to me that I always had to pause, shift gears mentally, get myself into a different frame of mind before I started to tell her about my travels. It was always a challenge to describe my experiences to her, or to describe them to most of the people I met.<br> My lifelong passion for observing birds and nature had been a gift, a treasure, coming out of nowhere in earliest childhood. It had provided me an intensity of experience beyond what most people have in their daily lives. But it also had made it harder for me to communicate with those who did not share this level of fascination. If I told everything the way it truly happened, the way it felt, it would sound like an exaggeration to anyone who had not been there. So I often found myself applying a kind of conversion factor, toning everything down to a milder and more general description.<br> How could I describe my trip to South America in a way that would mean something to my mother? She already knew the basics: I was paid to act as a tour guide, leading groups of bird watchers to exotic destinations to show them types of birds that they had never seen before. It would be simple enough to say that our group had visited two main sites in the coastal cordillera and then had gone out to the flat llanos, the central plains of Venezuela. It would be simple enough to say that we had sixteen participants in the group and two of us leading the tour, simple enough to talk about the minibus and the hotels and the meals and the weather. But none of that would touch the essence, the core of the journey.<br> How could I describe the richness of the experience? I might want to tell my mother about the extraordinary variety of bird life in the tropics. For example, that the single nation of Venezuela, smaller than the state of Alaska, has twice as many different kinds of birds as all of the United States and Canada combined. But that comparison would mean something only to a person who had some concept of the bird life of the United States and Canada to begin with. To anyone else, it would be abstract in the extreme, the difference between x and two times x. I might try to fall back on numbers: to say that more than four hundred species of birds had been recorded here in the state of Kansas but that you&#x2019;d have to bust a gut to see two hundred of those in a week during the peak of spring migration, while Venezuela hosts more than fourteen hundred species of birds and we might see over four hundred of those in a ten-day trip, despite the greater logistical challenges. But any such spewing out of raw numbers would turn off the most devoted listener. I dared not go that route.<br> How could I make the essence of the experience come alive? I had already encountered the difficulty of explaining the terms bird watching&#x201d; and birding,&#x201d; which overlap in meaning and are both misleading. So many people not my mother, she was tolerant of any approach, but other people had expressed condescending amusement: How can you just sit there and watch a bird?&#x201d; As if it were some kind of toothless voyeurism. So many times I had tried to explain that it was mostly not a matter of watching, more an activity of seeking and finding and recognizing. That there was a sense of accomplishment in learning these birds: being able to go out to the tidal flats and recognize all the sandpipers, for example, to know the subtle differences among twenty species there. That on every trip afield we birders would find dozens of species of birds, most of them expected, a few not. That there was reassurance in going out and finding the wrens, flickers, kestrels, thrushes, finches right where we anticipated they would be. That there was reassurance in the expected seasonal patterns: the blackburnian warblers coming north on their way to Canada in April, the golden plovers passing through southbound in September, the tree sparrows arriving for the winter in November, just as they did every year.<br> Then I might explain that the reassuring predictability of bird life was only half of the attraction the other half was provided by the element of unpredictability, the chance for novelty. Birds have wings. Even on familiar ground there is always the chance that some totally unexpected bird will show up. And we could be sure that if we went to some new place, there would be new and different birds there. I had taken my tour group to Venezuela with full certainty that I would show them types of birds they had never seen before, but with no way to predict exactly which birds those would be. Birding is like a treasure hunt, with thousands of potential treasures waiting to be found.<br> How could I describe the heart of the experience? I might want to focus on one moment in the field, on a moment of learning, when my understanding increased and with it my three-dimensional view of my world. I might describe, for example, watching a mixed flock of birds moving through the treetops in the jungle at Rancho Grande. Looking out from the trail toward the steep downhill side, so that the tops of the nearby trees were at eye level, with sunlight filtering through and sparkling on drops of mist on the moss and bromeliads that covered the high branches. Focusing on a small brown bird called a streaked xenops and seeing, for the first time, how it would hammer on a branch with its little wedge-shaped bill, prying off a bit of dead bark to look for insects underneath, so that it was searching for food in a slightly different way than any of the twenty other kinds of birds traveling with it. One more tiny bit of information to add to my store of knowledge. But it was so hard to tell this in a way that would mean anything to a person who had not been there. My mother would listen if I told her, and she would try to care about the fact that I had learned something, but she could hardly be expected to care about the streaked xenops, a bird she had never heard of before and would never hear of again.<br> No, the truth was that I could not hope to communicate by talking about the birds themselves. For most of the people with whom I would be speaking, that was psychologically foreign territory, more distant and unfamiliar than the wilds of Venezuela. But I had to say something now. My mother was looking at me, waiting, her eyes shining as they always did when she looked at one of her sons maybe shining also with a trace of tears, from trying to ignore the physical pain she was undoubtedly feeling. I had to tell her a story that would occupy her attention.<br> This was no time for dry details of ornithology. My subject matter would have to come from that frontier where the world of birds intersects with the world of the humans who pursue them.</p><h2>Horse Heaven</h2><p>#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK<br><br>"A WISE, SPIRITED NOVEL . . .

[Smiley's] final chapters have a wonderful restorative quality."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br>"RICHLY DETAILED, INGENIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED . . . YOU WILL REVEL IN JANE<br>SMILEY'S HORSE HEAVEN."<br>--San Diego Union-Tribune<br><br>Chosen by the Los Angeles Times as One of the Best Books of the Year<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>It takes a great deal of faith to gear a novel this horse-besotted to the general public. Horse love is one of those things either you get or you don't, and for the vast majority of the populace, horse stories tend to read like porn written for 13-year-old girls. The good news, then, is that while a love of all things equine is not a prerequisite for enjoying Jane Smiley's <i>Horse Heaven</i>, a love of human perversity is. Racing, after all, is at worst a dangerous, asset-devouring folly and at best an anachronism, as one of her horse trainers notes: <blockquote> The Industry Leaders had made it their personal mission to bring horse racing to the attention of the general public, with the NFL as their model and television as their medium of choice, which was fine with Farley, though his own view was that horse racing out at the track, newspaper reading, still photography, placing bets in person, and writing thank-you notes by hand were all related activities, and football, ESPN, video, on-line betting, and not writing thank-you notes at all were another set of related activities. </blockquote> A crucial piece of information for Smiley fans is that, among her many novels, <i>Horse Heaven</i> most resembles <i>Moo</i>. (And there's even a pig!) In fact, with these two books it appears that this versatile author has finally found a home in which to unpack her impressive gifts: that is, the sprawling, intricately plotted satirical novel. Her target in this case is not academia but horse racing--less commonly satirized but, here at least, just as fruitfully so. Wickedly knowing, dryly comic, the result is as much fun to read as it must have been to write.<p> None of which means that <i>Horse Heaven</i> is a casual read. For starters, one practically needs a racing form to keep track of its characters, particularly when their stories begin to overlap and converge in increasingly unlikely and pleasing ways. Perhaps it says something about the novel that the easiest figures to follow are the horses themselves: loutish Epic Steam, the "monster" colt; the winsome filly Residual; supernaturally focused Limitless; and trembling little Froney's Sis. And that's not to forget <i>Horse Heaven</i>'s single most prepossessing character, Justa Bob--a little swaybacked, a little ewe-necked, but possessed of a fine sense of humor and an abiding disdain for winning races by anything but a nose. </p><p> Then there are the humans, including but not limited to socialite Rosalind Maybrick, her husband Al (who manufactures "giant heavy metal objects" in "distant impoverished nationlike locations"), a Zen trainer, a crooked trainer, a rapper named Ho Ho Ice Chill, an animal psychic, and a futurist scholar, as well as attendant jockeys, grooms, and hangers-on. (Not to mention poor, ironically named Joy, a few years out of Moo U and still having problems relating.) It's a little frustrating to watch this cast come and go and fight for Smiley's attention; you glimpse them so vividly, and then they disappear for another hundred pages, and it breaks your heart. </p><p> But there are certainly worse problems a novel could have than characters to whom you grow overattached. A plot this convoluted would be one, if only it weren't so hard to stop reading. There are elements of magic realism, astounding coincidences, unabashed anthropomorphism. (At one point--while Justa Bob throws himself against his stall in sorrow at leaving his owner's tiny, wordless mother behind--this reviewer cried, "Shameless!" even as she began to tear up.) Improbably, it all works. <i>Horse Heaven</i> is a great, joyous, big-hearted entertainment, a stakes winner by any measure, and for both horse lovers and fans of Smiley's dry, character-based wit, a cause for celebration on par with winning the Triple Crown. <i>--Mary Park</i></p><p>"A fast-paced, fetchingly detailed, wide-angled view of the world of horse breeding--and racing--and another lively illustration of Smiley's industrious literary work-ethic and gift for trasmuting the products of her obviously extensive research into compelling fiction."<br>-- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br></p><p>"A narrative act of balancing so ambitious and so precisely executed that it becomes necessary to see Smiley as half acrobat, half writer; the novel is at least as athletic as the animals it describes. It is also a profound act of love... the horses move beyond sympathy to an even higher state of grace."<br>-- Pam Houston, <i>Elle</i><br></p><p>"Smiley, it turns out, knows a prodigious amount about Thoroughbreds, and she is as good at describing the stages of their lives, their temperaments and personalities as she is in chronicling the ambitions, financial windfalls and ruins, love affairs, partings and reconciliations of her large cast of human characters.... Written with high spirits and enthusiasm, distinguished by Smiley's wry humor (as in <i>Moo</i>), the novel gallops into the home stretch without losing momentum." <br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br></p><p>"A spirited new novel...Witty, energetic sentences are a hallmark of the novel...What's remarkable about Smiley's handling of horses as characters is that she manages to bring it off at all--and more, she does it brilliantly. Through an amazing imaginative leap, she enters into their heads and lets us see the world as they do...The racetrack provides an ideal, multidimensional backdrop for all the plots and subplots Smiley puts in motion...It's deeply satisfying to read a work of fiction so informed about its subject and so alive to every nuance and detail...She has immersed herself in the anecdotes and the lore of the track, and that allows her to create some nifty set pieces...A big, ambitious book....A smart, warmhearted, winning book "<br>-- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br></p><p>"Smiley's horses almost steal the show from the humans in this symphonic celebration of the byzantine world of thoroughbred horse racing--although a mischievous Jack Russell terrier named Eileen rules supreme whenever the all-seeing narrative eye pans her way.... Smiley enriches her electrifying and at times melodramatic tale of two years on the thoroughbred racing circut with a wealth of intimate knowledge about horse breeding, training, and racing, not to mention sensuous description and supple human and equine psychology."<br>-- <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br></p><p>"Jane Smiley might consider a patent on virtuosity . . . Thackeray did it with the beau monde in <b>Vanity Fair</b>, Heller with war in <b>Catch 22</b>, and now Smiley with the world of thoroughbred racing . . . There are as many intriguing stories in this work as there are in a rich hunman life, and Smiley manages to bring them together in a deft directorial performance."<br>-- <i>Bookpage</i><br><br></p></p><h2>All-of-a-Kind Family Downtown</h2><p>The further adventures of five sisters and their brother growing up on New York&#39;s East Side in the early twentieth century.</p><p><b>Sydney Taylor</b> grew up among immigrant families on New York City's Lower East Side prior to World War I and wrote the All-of-a-Kind Family stories for her daughter.In the All-of-a-Kind series, Taylor presents a insider's view of early-1900s New York through the eyes of five spirited sisters. Suzanne Toren skillfully portrays the immigrant parents' accents, the chirpy children, and even sings a beautiful ballad. She also convincingly recreates the well-written text and performs a subplot in which a child confronts her conscience most believably. Listeners feel privy to each child's reactions and thoughts as she experiences the often harsh conditions of the city, as well as her warm and loving home life. A worthwhile message of tolerance, endurance, and friendship is subtly projected in these true-to-life vignettes. Everyone will enjoy and benefit from meeting the All-of-a-Kind Family. S.G.B.

Never one to limit himself in form or content, Moore has also published novels,&nbsp;<i>Voice of the Fire&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Jerusalem</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;an epic poem,&nbsp;<i>The Mirror of Love.&nbsp;</i>Four of his ground-breaking graphic novels&#x2014;<i>From Hell</i>,&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>,&nbsp;<i>V for Vendetta</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>&#x2014;have been adapted to the silver screen. Moore currently resides in Northampton, England.</p><h2>DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore</h2><p>Presents a collection of classic comic book stories about superheroes by Alan Moore.</p><p>Alan Moore is one of the most respected and admired writers in comics today, with a host of industry awards and accolades. His credits include The Ballad of Halo Jones, Captain Britain, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Lost Girls, Promethea, Swamp Thing, V For Vendetta and Watchmen.While Moore was evolving the superhero story with his work on <i>Swamp Thing </i>and <i>Watchmen </i>in the '80s he was also taking smaller freelance assignments for DC Comics. The works in DC's newly assembled collection of these stories (all previously available in various collections and put together for the first time here) don't possess the same momentousness as those titles but still provide an interesting side of Moore's oeuvre. Many of the stories are superheroes tales told with such wit and imagination that they reach all the promise the genre offers. The best is "Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?," a heartfelt sendoff to the Silver Age&#x2013;era of Superman comics rendered by the greatest Superman artist, Curt Swan. Many of the shorter pieces feature Moore's knack for coming up with science fiction twist endings that always amuse. The Green Lantern back-up "Mogo Doesn't Socialize" is as inventive as it is brief. Other stories feel like a dated part of the grim 1980s."The Killing Joke," featuring Batman and stunning art by Brian Bolland, and a Vigilante story are both dark and serious tales but they lack both Moore's virtuoso storytelling tricks and the complexity and humanity of his best work. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Prepared during the artist&#39;s lifetime and with his co-operation, it is described as an intimate look at the man behind the silkscreened image.</p><p>Warhol, the self-promoting "king of Pop" who pictorially chronicled American society--its faces, products, and events--may be one of this century's least understood artists. Given the recent spate of Warhol reminiscences, this biography is a good value: Words and pictures clarify his life and career, and the coffee-table format, offering over 300 reproductions that include personal photos and art--is visually satisfying. The author is an art critic who was also a colleague and long-time Warhol chum. His perspective is comprehensive, informed, and blunt without being too gossipy or sensational. The text, based on first-hand knowledge of Warhol as well as extensive interviews with his family and friends, conveys Warhol's struggle to find his own niche in the art world, his attempts to discover new forms, his role as a cult figure and mentor, and his personal idiosyncrasies.<br><i>- Robin Kaplan, Los Angeles</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Art critic Bourdon, whose friendship with Warhol dated back to the early 1960s, presents a well-illustrated critical biography of the seminal pop artist and media personality. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Nativity</h2><p>For centuries, the Gospels have brought to audiences of all ages the story of the birth of Christ, from the breathtaking appearance of the angel Gabriel to the arduous journey of the three wise men, from Herod&#x2019;s chilling decree to the return of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus to Nazareth. The text of this book, drawn from the books of Matthew and Luke, becomes all the more vivid when paired with the luminous and detailed illustrations of talented artist Ruth Sanderson. Elaborate borders combine the traditional elements of an illuminated manuscript with a contemporary palette to make this spectacular volume a book to be treasured and shared with family and friends.</p><p>Ruth Sanderson has illustrated many books for children,including Cinderella and The Snow Princess(both Little, Brown) and the companion volumes Saints:Lives and Illuminations and More Saints: Lives andIlluminations. Her artistic style is inspired byRenaissance art, icons, illuminated manuscripts, oldengravings, and woodcuts.

An Anglo-Saxon delegation arrives in Cashel to debate the new religious rules that have been handed down from Rome. The Abbot of Imleach leads the Irish delegation, which is hostile to the new rules from outsiders. Among the Anglo-Saxon group is Brother Eadulf's own younger brother, Egric, whom Eadulf hasn't seen for many years. </p><p>When the debate quickly becomes acrimonious, a local abbess has to step in as a mediator between the two sides. But not even a day later her body is discovered, bludgeoned to death. The Chief Brehon Aill�n accuses young Egric of murder, and suspicions and tempers run high. With the war of words threatening to spill over into bloodshed, Fidelma is sure there is something more sinister behind the murder than religious differences, and she is resolved to find out what really happened-and why.</p></p><p>PETER TREMAYNE is a pseudonym of Peter Berresford Ellis, a renowned scholar who has written extensively on the ancient Celts and the Irish. As Tremayne, he is best known for his stories and novels featuring Fidelma of Cashel, beginning with <i>Absolution by Murder</i>.

The &#34;loving Father&#34; image with which most children are familiar tells them much about our God, but it cannot say it all. Heart Talks with Mother God is an extraordinary book for parents, teachers, and caregivers who want to help young children experience another metaphor for God. Its stories, songs, pictures, prayers, and activities introduce children to the nurturing, tender care of Mother God, who loves them unconditionally. These stories tell girls &#34;yes, I am created in God&#39;s image,&#34; and they introduce both girls and boys to the feminine face of God found in Scripture. Heart Talks with Mother God includes ten Scripture-inspired, beautifully illustrated &#34;prayer stories&#34; for children. A &#34;preparation guide&#34; for parents, teachers, and other adult caregivers suggests ways in which these stories can be used to minister to children?including those who do not have a male caregiving figure in their lives. A &#34;story guide&#34; suggests ways to lead into and out of the individual stories so that they become prayer experiences. Three songs celebrate the life-giving nature of God. Heart Talks with Mother God is more than just a storybook for children; it is a moment of prayer spent in a mother&#39;s tender embrace.&#34;. . . the quality of the writing and the illustrations is exceptionally good.&#34; The Christian Ministry&#34;Heart Talks with Mother God is the treasure trove find of the season.&#34; Book Room Review&#34;This is a wonderful 8 1/2 x 11 sized learning book for child and adult alike.

As both knowledgeable insider and keen observer of a passing culture, he writes of the independent, tough, skilled members of a few large families who have fished those coastal waters for generations, but who no longer can make a living in the face of regulations, political restrictions, economic pres sures, and biased opposition from an gling groups. This is a somewhat melan choly portrait of frontier characters bowing to modernism, but it is also a masterful celebration of craft, of pride in one's work, of community, of endur ance. Finely written and highly recom mended for public and academic librar ies in the Northeast and for American studies collections everywhere. Photos not seen. Roland Person, Southern Il linois Univ.

This moving portrait of Brother Francis's selfless way of life, his concerns for those less fortunate than himself, the love he lavished on birds and animals--all of these elements are effectively presented in a straightforward, inspirational style. Cole does not preach, but lets the real humanity of this man emerge clearly. Lemieux's glowing, medieval-style paintings are a perfect complement, and her flattened perspective and burnished palette are appropriate to the period. Brother Francis finds a special way to bring the Christmas story to life when, with the aid of a few villagers, he restages the Nativity on a hillside near the Italian village of Greccio. Highly recommended as a Christmas gift, this work will encourage readers to reflect on the beauty and true meaning of the holiday season.

In typical Todd fashion, he also contributed notes about each recipe. Here are his thoughts about the spice mix called garam masala: "Masala is what gives Indian food its tone and feeling. According to</i> Hobson-Jobson,<i> the quirky Anglo-Indian dictionary, </i>masala<i> means 'materials, ingredients . . . or things . . . conducive to good.' Masala most commonly refers to a mix of spices, and garam means warm or hot in Hindi. The spices in garam masala are thought to be warming. Think gingerbread. Use these 'warm materials' to spice up your food and life."</i><br><br>1. Combine the cumin, peppercorns, cardamom pods, coriander, cloves, fennel, cinnamon, and bay leaves in a large, dry skillet. Toast the spices over high heat, tossing or stirring them occasionally, until they have browned lightly and are fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the garam masala to a bowl to cool.<br><br>2. When the garam masala has cooled, grind it into a fine powder in a spice grinder, clean coffee grinder, sturdy blender, or mortar and pestle. Transfer the ground masala to a bowl and whisk in the ginger and nutmeg.<br><br>3. Store the garam masala in an airtight container, away from heat, light, and moisture, for up to 6 months.<br>A QUESTION I get asked a lot on my show is how to store dried herbs and spices. Both herbs and spices should be kept in a cool dark place, preferably a closed cupboard or drawer. They will last for about six months, depending on how long they were sitting on the shelf before you purchased them. You can tell by their color how fresh they are. Dried herbs go from green to gray as they age; dried spices also fade in color. (For example, paprika and cayenne should look red, not brown.) What happens after six months? It is not like spices and herbs go bad and will harm you; they just lose flavor, and it will take more of them to get the same effect in a dish. Whole spices have a longer shelf life than ground. You can purchase one of those little coffee grinders and use it exclusively for spices (unless you want your coffee to taste like cumin and coriander). You can even go one step further and intensify the flavor by toasting the spices in a small dry skillet over low heat until they are fragrant, and then grinding them. The best way to clean your spice grinder is to grind a little bread in it. Discard the bread and wipe the grinder out. The bread takes most of the spice aroma out of the grinder.<br><b>Bread Crumbs Four Ways</b><br>Hands-on time:<br>2 minutes<br>Total preparation time:<br>2 minutes<br>FRESH BREAD CRUMBS<br><br>MAKES ABOUT 2 1/2 CUPS<br><br><i>The bread crumbs you buy in the supermarket are certainly very convenient but often very stale, and will only get more so if you leave them on your shelf for a while.

Now he offers essential guidance that will enable parents and educators to better understand music as an aid to growth, development, mental and physical health, and creative awakening in our most precious human resource.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A recent study found that visual tracking, eye-hand coordination, and other positive behaviors developed more rapidly in babies whose mothers participated in a pilot program of prenatal exposure to music. Another study found that remedial first graders who were given seven months of music instruction and visual arts training soon caught up in all subjects with an average group of children not exposed to the arts, and actually surpassed them in math.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It has been proven time and time again that music is a powerful implement for stimulating a child's brain, nourishing his spirit, and strengthening his body, even prior to birth. Giving your daughter or son the incomparable gift of music helps your child rapidly and decisively reach his or her emotional and intellectual potential, and stimulates wondrous areas of mental awareness and creative discovery that might otherwise lie dormant.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In <em>The Mozart Effect for Children</em>, author Don Campbell shows that music is the perfect tool to improve children's language, movement, and emotional skills at home, school, and play. He presents a wealth of dynamic, inventive ways for parents and teachers to invigorate a child's imagination with music, sounds, and songs, supplying simple exercises and fun activities tailored for each age group and stage of development, from prenatal through age ten. Campbell offers ideas and exercises both practical and profound, from special ways for parents to bond with their newborns to tips on fostering good study habits and stress reduction for elementary school students.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>The Mozart Effect for Children</em> is an invaluable resource for any parent and every child, as well as for grandparents and educators. With Campbell's fascinating, informed, and compassionate guidance -- and with the incredible, uplifting power of tone, rhythm, and melody you can help the child in your life aspire, achieve, and grow healthier in mind, body, and spirit.</p><p></p></p><p>Don Campbell's reputation runs the gamut from serious educator bent on improving the health and intelligence of his audience to clever marketer, making a fast buck from specially trademarked pseudoscience. In <i>The Mozart Effect for Children</i>, Campbell explains early on why Mozart's music is thought to have such amazing powers, and while he cites no statistics or studies, his lyrical explanations of Mozart's simplicity and elegance will have many reader's heads nodding in agreement--it's difficult to disagree with "his music is at once deeply mysterious and accessible, and above all, without guile". A few pages are devoted to descriptions of studies done by French specialist Dr. Alfred Tomatis, and "Spotlight on Specialist" pages throughout the book are an attempt to add a more clearly scientific feel. Still, most of what passes for science in this book is anecdotal and will not make a satisfying read for those looking for original research.<p> Each chapter is devoted to a particular age, from prenatal to mid-elementary school, and parents and educators can find excellent musical menus, practical suggestions, and entertaining games to play at the end of every chapter. The menus include suggestions for appropriate times to play the various pieces, as well as a brief description of the type of music, helpful in case you're not immediately familiar with "Adagio from the Divertimento" or "Concertante from the Serenade No. 9". Games range from simple variations on pat-a-cake to rhythmic chanting designed to improve memory skills, and parents will enjoy playing at least as much as their children will. Perhaps you child's IQ will magically improve from listening to Mozart, perhaps it won't. At worst, Campbell opens up a world of music-related learning for your family that can be both enriching and entertaining. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Listen to Don Campbell's credentials.<p>A Texas native, Don Campbell studied with Nadia Boulanger at the Fontainebleau Conservatory of Music in France and has worked with Jean Houston, Leonard Bernstein and other musicians, healers and mind/body researchers.</p><p>Over the years, his quest to harness the healing and creative powers of sound and music has taken him to 40 countries, including Haiti, Russia, Israel, Greece, Tibet, Indonesia and Thailand, where he has studied indigenous culture, taught and worked with children and young adults, and given his own performances.

Horten, get it?&#x2014;thinks he&#x2019;s facing a long, boring summer when his parents pack the three of them up and move to his father&#x2019;s hometown as school lets out. His parents are a pleasantly oblivious pair: His mom is an unimaginative doctor, and his father designs crosswords for a living.

There, Stuart discovers that his Great-Uncle Tony Horten, who disappeared years ago without a trace, was both an inventor of mechanical devices and a magician. A chance phone call in a broken phone booth is the first step in a journey that leads Stuart around town, as he unearths his great-uncle's legacy and secrets. Stuart also draws the attention of April, May, and June (the journalistically inclined triplets next door), as well as Beeton residents with more sinister intentions. Evans has crafted an old-fashioned mystery of the kids-besting-clueless-adults variety.

All he has are five mutilated corpses and five dead little birds.<br><br>Mo Hayder - with&nbsp;&nbsp;a keen psychological insight, brilliant forensic and procedural detail, and a psychically wounded but charismatic lead investigator - has written a first novel of raw intensity and deep understanding that will thrill the hearts of the most demanding readers of crime fiction.</p><p>This crackling psychological thriller introduces police detective Jack Caffery, who is on the hunt for a serial killer the British tabloids have nicknamed "The Millennium Ripper." <p>The Ripper is behind the murder of five prostitutes, whose bodies are unearthed beneath the rubble of a Greenwich landfill. All the victims have been raped and their bodies horrendously mutilated--but not until after being killed by a dose of heroin injected directly into their brainstems. What stuns Caffery even more is the one detail of the murders the public doesn't know; the hearts of the women have been replaced with live birds sewn into the victims' chests. </p><p>Caffery himself is a tortured man, still burdened by guilt over the decades-old murder of his younger brother and frustrated because he cannot bring the man he knows is responsible to the bar of justice. When the Millennium Ripper confesses to the prostitute killings just before taking his own life, Caffery faces his own limitations and begins to make peace with his past. But then another prostitute is found dead, her body ravaged in the same way, a bird where her heart was--and Caffery realizes that his past may never truly be put to rest. </p><p>A solid page turner, this gripping debut by a young Englishwoman introduces a complex and fascinating protagonist destined for another appearance.

This book is about the more challenging, relaxing, and enjoyable experiences that I have known -- both at work and at play. I have described personal hobbies, excursions to exotic places, political campaigns, volunteer work, fishing, skiing, climbing mountains, baseball, family vacations, and simply relaxed days and nights with little to do except exchange memories and ideas with family and friends across the years and across generations.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Few of these adventures have been especially newsworthy, and I still enjoy some of them in solitude, but the main lesson I have struggled to learn is that the experiences are more deep and lasting sources of pleasure when they are shared with others.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It has not been easy for me to accept this fact. Perhaps like most other people, I have had to overcome a self-centered inclination to live on my own terms, sometimes obsessed with intense ambition, bringing others into the private recesses of my life only reluctantly. I've come to realize that even my loved ones and I could enjoy the same event without really sharing the essence of it, and that it takes a lot of effort to sense and accommodate the desires of others in a generous way. This lifetime of learning has paid rich dividends, for me and for those with whom I have learned to really share.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope that these personal experiences will prove to be a practical and inspirational guide to anyone desiring to stretch mind and heart, to combine work and pleasure, and to reach out to others.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2004 by Jimmy Carter</p></p><h2>Grumman: Sixty Years of Excellence</h2><p>Grumman: Sixty Years of Excellence, written by the world&#39;s foremost aviation writer, tells the story of men and machines that have made Grumman so special.

He was<br>fishing on the north shore of Chew Valley Lake, a 1200-acre<br>reservoir at the foot of the Mendip Hills south of Bristol. He<br>had already taken three brown trout of respectable weight.<br><br>He watched keenly for a telltale swirl in the calm lake<br>where he had cast. The conditions were promising. It was an<br>evening late in September, the sky was overcast and the flies<br>in their millions had just whirled above him in their spectacular<br>sunset flight, soaring and swooping over the lake in a<br>mass darker and more dense than the clouds, their droning<br>as resonant as a train in the underground. The day&#x2019;s hatch,<br>irresistible to hungry fish.<br><br>A light south-westerly fretted the surface around him, yet<br>ahead there was this bar of water, known to fishermen as the<br>scum, that showed a different pattern in the fading light.<br>There, he knew by experience, the fish preferred to rise.<br><br>So preoccupied was the man that he failed altogether to<br>notice a pale object at closer proximity. It drifted languidly<br>in the current created by the wind, more than half submerged,<br>with a slight rocking motion that fitfully produced<br>a semblance of life.<br><br>Finally it touched him. A white hand slid against his<br>thigh. A complete arm angled outwards as the body lodged<br>against him, trapped at the armpit. It was a dead woman,<br>face-up and naked.<br><br>The fisherman glanced down. From high in his throat<br>came a childishly shrill, indrawn cry.<br><br>For a moment he stood as if petrified. Then he made an<br>effort to gather himself mentally so as to disentangle himself<br>from the undesired embrace. Unwilling to touch the<br>corpse with his hands, he used the handle of the rod as a<br>lever, lodging the end in the armpit and pushing the body<br>away from him, turning it at the same time, then stepping<br>aside to let it move on its way with the current. That accomplished,<br>he grabbed his net from its anchorage in the mud<br>and, without even stopping to reel in his line, splashed his<br>way to the bank. There, he looked about him. No one was<br>in sight.<br><br>This angler was not public-spirited. His response to the<br>discovery was to bundle his tackle together and move off to<br>his car as fast as possible.<br><br>He did have one judicious thought. Before leaving, he<br>opened the bag containing his catch and threw the three<br>trout back into the water.<br>TWO <br><br>A LITTLE AFTER 10.30 THE same Saturday evening,<br>Police Constable Harry Sedgemoor and his wife Shirley<br>were watching a horror video in their terraced cottage in<br>Bishop Sutton, on the eastern side of the lake. PC Sedgemoor<br>had come off duty at six. His long body was stretched<br>along the length of the sofa, his bare feet projecting over<br>one end. On this hot night he had changed into a black<br>singlet and shorts. A can of Malthouse Bitter was in his left<br>hand, while his right was stroking Shirley&#x2019;s head, idly teasing<br>out the black curls and feeling them spring back into<br>shape. Shirley, after her shower dressed only in her white<br>cotton nightie, reclined on the floor, propped against the<br>sofa. She had her eyes closed. She had lost interest in the<br>film, but she didn&#x2019;t object to Harry watching if it resulted<br>afterwards in his snuggling up close to her in bed, as he<br>usually did after watching a horror film. Secretly, she suspected<br>he was more scared by them than she, but you didn&#x2019;t<br>suggest that sort of thing to your husband, particularly if he<br>happened to be a policeman. So she waited patiently for<br>it to end. The tape hadn&#x2019;t much longer to run. Harry had<br>several times pressed the fast-forward button to get through<br>boring bits of conversation.<br><br>The violins on the video soundtrack were working up to<br>a piercing crescendo when the Sedgemoors both heard the<br>click of their own front gate. Shirley said bitterly, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t<br>believe it! What time is it?&#x2019;<br><br>Her husband sighed, swung his legs off the sofa, got up<br>and looked out of the window. &#x2018;Some woman.&#x2019; He couldn&#x2019;t<br>see much in the porch light.<br><br>He recognized the caller when he opened the door:<br>Miss Trenchard-Smith, who lived alone in one of the older<br>houses at the far end of the village. An upright seventy-yearold<br>never seen without her Tyrolean hat, which over the<br>years had faded in colour from a severe brown to a shade<br>that was starting to fit in with the deep pink of the local<br>stone.<br><br>&#x2018;I hesitate to disturb you so late, Officer,&#x2019; she said as her<br>eyes travelled over his shorts and singlet in a series of rapid<br>jerks. &#x2018;However, I think you will agree that what I have found<br>is sufficiently serious to justify this intrusion.&#x2019; Her gratingly<br>genteel accent articulated the words with self-importance.<br>She may have lived in the village since the war, but she<br>would never pass as local and probably didn&#x2019;t care to.<br>PC Sedgemoor said with indulgence, &#x2018;What might that<br>be, Miss Trenchard-Smith?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A dead body.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A body?&#x2019; He fingered the tip of his chin and tried to<br>appear unperturbed, but his pulses throbbed. After six<br>months in the force he had yet to be called to a corpse.<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith continued with her explanation.<br>&#x2018;I was walking my cats by the lake. People don&#x2019;t believe that<br>cats like to be taken for walks, but mine do. Every evening<br>about this time. They insist on it. They won&#x2019;t let me sleep if<br>I haven&#x2019;t taken them out.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A human body, you mean?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, of course. A woman. Not a stitch of clothing on<br>her, poor creature.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;d better show me. Is it . . . is she nearby?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;In the lake, if she hasn&#x2019;t floated away already.&#x2019;<br><br>Sedgemoor refrained from pointing out that the body<br>would remain in the lake even if it had floated away. He<br>needed Miss Trenchard-Smith&#x2019;s co-operation. He invited<br>her into the cottage for a moment while he ran upstairs to<br>collect a sweater and his personal radio.<br><br>Shirley, meanwhile, had stood up and wished a good evening<br>to Miss Trenchard-Smith, whose tone in replying made<br>it plain that in her view no respectable woman ought to be<br>seen in her nightwear outside the bedroom.<br><br>&#x2018;What a horrid experience for you!&#x2019; Shirley remarked,<br>meaning what had happened beside the lake. &#x2018;Would you<br>care for a nip of something to calm you down?&#x2019;<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith curtly thanked her and declined.<br>&#x2018;But you can look after my cats while I&#x2019;m gone,&#x2019; she said as<br>if bestowing a favour on Shirley. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t mind cats, do<br>you?&#x2019; Without pausing to get an answer she went to the door<br>and called, &#x2018;Come on, come on, come on,&#x2019; and two Siamese<br>raced from the shadows straight into the cottage and leapt<br>on to the warm spot Harry had vacated on the sofa as if it<br>were prearranged.<br><br>When Harry came down again, Shirley glanced at what<br>he was wearing and said, &#x2018;I thought you were going upstairs<br>to put some trousers on.&#x2019;<br><br>He said, &#x2018;I might have to wade in and fetch something<br>out, mightn&#x2019;t I?&#x2019;<br><br>She shuddered.<br><br>He picked his torch off the shelf by the door. Managing<br>to sound quite well in control, he said, &#x201c;Bye, love.&#x2019; He<br>kissed Shirley lightly and tried to provide more reassurance<br>by whispering, &#x2018;I expect she imagined it.&#x2019;<br><br>Not that tough old bird, Shirley thought. If she says she<br>found a corpse, it&#x2019;s there.<br><br>Harry Sedgemoor was less certain. While driving Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith the half-mile or so down to the lakeside<br>he seriously speculated that she might be doing this out<br>of a desire to enliven her placid routine with gratuitous<br>excitement. Old women living alone had been known to<br>waste police time with tall stories. If this were the case he<br>would be incensed. He was damned sure Shirley wouldn&#x2019;t<br>want to make love after this. Whatever there might or<br>might not be in the lake, the mention of a corpse would<br>colour her imagination so vividly that nothing he did or<br>said would relax her.<br><br>With an effort to be the policeman, he asked Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith to tell him where to stop the car.<br><br>&#x2018;Anywhere you like,&#x2019; she said with an ominously nonchalant<br>air. &#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea where we are.&#x2019;<br><br>He halted where the road came to an end. They got out<br>and started across a patch of turf, his torch probing the<br>space ahead. The reservoir was enclosed by a low boundary<br>fence, beyond which clumps of reeds stirred in the breeze,<br>appearing to flicker in the torchlight. At intervals were flat<br>stretches of shoreline.<br><br>&#x2018;How exactly did you get down to the water?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>&#x2018;Through one of the gates.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Those are for fishermen only.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t disturb them.&#x2019; She gave a laugh. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t tell anyone<br>you broke the law.&#x2019;<br><br>He pushed open a gate and they picked their way down<br>to the water&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x2018;Was this the place?&#x2019;<br><br>She said, &#x2018;It all looks amazingly different now.&#x2019;<br><br>Containing his annoyance, he drew the torch-beam<br>slowly across a wide angle. &#x2018;You must have some idea. How<br>did you notice the body?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;There was still some daylight then.&#x2019;<br><br>Fifty yards along the bank was a place where the reeds<br>grew extra tall. &#x2018;Anywhere like that?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I suppose there&#x2019;s no harm in looking,&#x2019; she said.<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, miss.&#x2019;<br><br>He stepped in and felt his foot sink into soft mud. &#x2018;You&#x2019;d</p><h2>The Pigeon Wants a Puppy!</h2><p>When a bus driver takes a break from his route, a very unlikely volunteer springs up to take his place-a pigeon!

Just as each human thumbprint is unique, its pattern inscribed on the work of our hands and minds, the Creator's is even more so&#x2015;the original thumbprints on the universe," declares poet Luci Shaw. We worship an endlessly creative God whose thumbprints are reflected everywhere we look&#x2015;in sunsets, mountains, ocean waves&#x2015;and in the invisible rhythms that shape our lives, such as the movement of planets around the sun. And this creative and ever-creating God has also left indelible thumbprints on us. We reflect God's imprint most clearly, perhaps, in our own creating and appreciation for beauty. A longing for beauty is inherent to being human. We don't create things that are purely practical; we desire them to be aesthetically pleasing as well. Beauty is also powerful, in its redemptiveness, generosity, inspiration. In reflecting on the role of beauty in our lives, Luci Shaw writes, "Beauty is Love taking form in human lives and the works of their hands." So come, join Luci Shaw as she ponders through the beauty of poetry and prose the places, sometimes unexpected, where she encounters God's fingerprints, and let it help you learn to see them in your life as well.</p><p>Luci Shaw is a poet, essayist, lecturer and writer in residence at Regent College, Vancouver. A founding member of the Chrysostom Society of Christian Writers, Shaw is the author of ten volumes of poetry and other titles such as <em>Adventure of Ascent</em>, <em>Breath for the Bones</em>, <em>Harvesting Fog</em> and <em>Water My Soul</em>. She has also coauthored three books with Madeleine L'Engle. Her papers are preserved in the Luci Shaw Collection at Wheaton College's Buswell Library, and she lives in Bellingham, Washington."By the light shed by this book, we are better able to see our own God-imprinted lives as they're marked by penetrating mystery and indelible grace. Turn the page and engage the adventure!" (Susan S. Phillips, Radix, Vol. 39, No. 2)<br><br>"Halfway through <em>Thumbprint in the Clay</em>, I wasn't sure what I was reading. I only knew I wanted to absorb this writerly book with its lyric descriptions that awaken wonder. . . . You know she means it when she writes: 'I long for you to share my wonder and respond. I can point it out to you and believe that you will see it, too.' Shaw seeks a 'theory of everything' that includes Christian faith. She beckons the curious reader to dream awhile, drink deeply, and see the story we each inhabit as sacred." (Alice Camille, St. Anthony Messenger, June 2016)<br><br>"Shaw's practical book is inspiring and will give readers encouragement. Highly recommended." (CBA Retailers+Resources, April 16, 2016)<br><br>"Luci Shaw has spent a writing lifetime finding thumbprints in every square inch of creation and then pressing down more than a few for us to discover on our own. The glory of the prints she explores in this new collection of essays and occasional poems is attributable to the hand of the Creator. But what Luci does in <em>Thumbprint in the Clay</em> is what she always has done for the rest of us: she teaches us to see." (James Calvin Schaap, author of Reading Mother Teresa and Romey's Place)<br><br>"What a delight when someone has something really good to say, and then says it with such style and grace. Such is Luci Shaw! She sees and describes the divine thumbprints well." (Richard Rohr, OFM, Center for Action and Contemplation)<br><br>"Luci Shaw is a friend, seasoned soul and wise 'lady of letters' who writes 'from the edge of the known world.' Her inspired, enlightened, well-crafted essays guide us toward recognizing the marks of the maker in everyday life as she illustrates on each page how to take 'a long, loving look at the real' and find God there." (Dick Staub, author, broadcaster and founder of The Kindlings)<br><br>"Luci Shaw is a treasure, and <em>Thumbprint in the Clay</em> shows us yet again precisely why: this book is wise beyond measure, the writing beautiful beyond compare, and its heart a reflection of the one true God. We see the evidence of Christ everywhere around us, and yet we seem determined at times to overlook his proof. This meditation allows us to pause, ponder and bring close to our hearts the fact of God's design, his love and his purpose for our own lives. This is a beautiful, ruminative and necessary book." (Bret Lott, director, MFA in writing, The College of Charleston, author of Letters and Life)<br><br>"Luci has thrown clay upon a wheel yet once more and fashioned it into a delightful vessel filled with my favorite drink: the ambrosia of art, faith and creativity. Yes, I am besotted, but who can turn away from the poetry of a life lived so beautifully in service to God?" (Leslie Leyland Fields, author of Surviving the Island of Grace)<br><br>"What a joy it is to see life again through Luci Shaw's artistic vision. <em>Thumbprint in the Clay</em> is marked by the particular beauty of her ingenuity&#x2015;wisdom kilned into her through years of fully engaged living, poetry that flows forth from her creative magnanimity, and her attuned, sensuous awareness of hints of the Creator's presence in every nook, niche, name and soul that kneels before the Holy. Shaw invites us into the God-imprinted adventure of incarnate life, not a 'narrow destination.' Illuminated by this book, we see that the imprinted life is an experience of penetrating mystery and indelible grace." (Susan S. Phillips, New College Berkeley, author of Candlelight and The Cultivated Life)<br><br>"The value of this book is the mindfulness that it creates for the reader. In a modern world of rush and hurry, it is good to read something that slows down the pace and helps one to &#x2018;stop and smell the roses,' to ponder the beauty of creation. Those who believe in God as their Maker would no doubt appreciate <em>Thumbprint in the Clay</em> as a fresh reminder of divine beauty in nature. However, Shaw gives testimony of her Creator in such a poetic way that it might also capture the attention of a non-believer. It might at least cause them to consider the possibility of a Designer that has placed His 'thumbprint' on us all."

A few years ago I was driving home and heard a program called <i>Command Performance,</i> which was a variety show that went out to the troops during World War II. The episode I happened to hear was broadcast the day after V--J Day, on August 15, 1945.<br><br> The episode featured some of the era&#x2019;s biggest celebrities: Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Cary Grant, Bette Davis, and many others. But the most striking feature of the show was its tone of self--effacement and humility. The Allies had just completed one of the noblest military victories in human history. And yet there was no chest beating. Nobody was erecting triumphal arches.<br> &#x201c;Well, it looks like this is it,&#x201d; the host, Bing Crosby, opened. &#x201c;What can you say at a time like this? You can&#x2019;t throw your skimmer in the air. That&#x2019;s for run--of--the mill holidays. I guess all anybody can do is thank God it&#x2019;s over.&#x201d; The mezzo--soprano Ris� Stevens came on and sang a solemn version of &#x201c;Ave Maria,&#x201d; and then Crosby came back on to summarize the mood: &#x201c;Today, though, our deep--down feeling is one of humility.&#x201d;<br><br> That sentiment was repeated throughout the broadcast. The actor Burgess Meredith read a passage written by Ernie Pyle, the war correspondent. Pyle had been killed just a few months before, but he had written an article anticipating what victory would mean: &#x201c;We won this war because our men are brave and because of many other things&#x2014;-because of Russia, England, and China and the passage of time and the gift of nature&#x2019;s materials. We did not win it because destiny created us better than all other people. I hope that in victory we are more grateful than proud.&#x201d;<br><br> The show mirrored the reaction of the nation at large. There were rapturous celebrations, certainly. Sailors in San Francisco commandeered cable cars and looted liquor stores. The streets of New York&#x2019;s garment district were five inches deep in confetti.1 But the mood was divided. Joy gave way to solemnity and self--doubt.<br><br> This was in part because the war had been such an epochal event, and had produced such rivers of blood, that individuals felt small in comparison. There was also the manner in which the war in the -Pacific had ended&#x2014;-with the atomic bomb. People around the world had just seen the savagery human beings are capable of. Now here was a weapon that could make that savagery apocalyptic. &#x201c;The knowledge of victory was as charged with sorrow and doubt as with joy and gratitude,&#x201d; James Agee wrote in an editorial that week for <i>Time</i> magazine.<br><br> But the modest tone of <i>Command Performance</i> wasn&#x2019;t just a matter of mood or style. The people on that broadcast had been part of one of the most historic victories ever known. But they didn&#x2019;t go around telling themselves how great they were. They didn&#x2019;t print up bumper stickers commemorating their own awesomeness. Their first instinct was to remind themselves they were not morally superior to anyone else. Their collective impulse was to warn themselves against pride and self--glorification. They intuitively resisted the natural human tendency toward excessive self--love.<br><br> I arrived home before the program was over and listened to that radio show in my driveway for a time. Then I went inside and turned on a football game. A quarterback threw a short pass to a wide receiver, who was tackled almost immediately for a two--yard gain. The defensive player did what all professional athletes do these days in moments of personal accomplishment. He did a self--puffing victory dance, as the camera lingered.<br><br> It occurred to me that I had just watched more self--celebration after a two--yard gain than I had heard after the United States won World War&nbsp;II.<br><br> This little contrast set off a chain of thoughts in my mind. It occurred to me that this shift might symbolize a shift in culture, a shift from a culture of self--effacement that says &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s better than me, but I&#x2019;m no better than anyone else&#x201d; to a culture of self--promotion that says &#x201c;Recognize my accomplishments, I&#x2019;m pretty special.&#x201d; That contrast, while nothing much in itself, was like a doorway into the different ways it is possible to live in this world.<br><br>Little Me<br><br> In the years following that <i>Command Performance</i> episode, I went back and studied that time and the people who were prominent then. The research reminded me first of all that none of us should ever wish to go back to the culture of the mid--twentieth century. It was a more racist, sexist, and anti--Semitic culture. Most of us would not have had the opportunities we enjoy if we had lived back then. It was also a more boring culture, with bland food and homogeneous living arrangements. It was an emotionally cold culture. Fathers, in particular, frequently were unable to express their love for their own children. Husbands were unable to see the depth in their own wives. In so many ways, life is better now than it was then.<br><br> But it did occur to me that there was perhaps a strain of humility that was more common then than now, that there was a moral ecology, stretching back centuries but less prominent now, encouraging people to be more skeptical of their desires, more aware of their own weaknesses, more intent on combatting the flaws in their own natures and turning weakness into strength. People in this tradition, I thought, are less likely to feel that every thought, feeling, and achievement should be immediately shared with the world at large.<br><br> The popular culture seemed more reticent in the era of <i>Command Performance.</i> There were no message T--shirts back then, no exclamation points on the typewriter keyboards, no sympathy ribbons for various diseases, no vanity license plates, no bumper stickers with personal or moral declarations. People didn&#x2019;t brag about their college affiliations or their vacation spots with little stickers on the rear windows of their cars. There was stronger social sanction against (as they would have put it) blowing your own trumpet, getting above yourself, being too big for your britches.<br><br> The social code was embodied in the self--effacing style of actors like Gregory Peck or Gary Cooper, or the character Joe Friday on <i>Dragnet.</i> When Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s aide Harry Hopkins lost a son in World War II, the military brass wanted to put his other sons out of harm&#x2019;s way. Hopkins rejected this idea, writing, with the understatement more common in that era, that his other sons shouldn&#x2019;t be given safe assignments just because their brother &#x201c;had some bad luck in the Pacific.&#x201d;2<br><br> Of the twenty--three men and women who served in Dwight Eisenhower&#x2019;s cabinets, only one, the secretary of agriculture, published a memoir afterward, and it was so discreet as to be soporific. By the time the Reagan administration rolled around, twelve of his thirty cabinet members published memoirs, almost all of them self--advertising.3<br><br> When the elder George Bush, who was raised in that era, was running for president, he, having inculcated the values of his childhood, resisted speaking about himself. If a speechwriter put the word &#x201c;I&#x201d; in one of his speeches, he&#x2019;d instinctively cross it out. The staff would beg him: You&#x2019;re running for president. You&#x2019;ve got to talk about yourself. Eventually they&#x2019;d cow him into doing so. But the next day he&#x2019;d get a call from his mother. &#x201c;George, you&#x2019;re talking about yourself again,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. And Bush would revert to form. No more I&#x2019;s in the speeches. No more self--promotion.<br><br>The Big Me<br><br> Over the next few years I collected data to suggest that we have seen a broad shift from a culture of humility to the culture of what you might call the Big Me, from a culture that encouraged people to think humbly of themselves to a culture that encouraged people to see themselves as the center of the universe.<br><br> It wasn&#x2019;t hard to find such data. For example, in 1950, the Gallup Organization asked high school seniors if they considered themselves to be a very important person. At that point, 12 percent said yes. The same question was asked in 2005, and this time it wasn&#x2019;t 12 percent who considered themselves very important, it was 80 percent.<br><br> Psychologists have a thing called the narcissism test. They read people statements and ask if the statements apply to them. Statements such as &#x201c;I like to be the center of attention&nbsp;. . . I show off if I get the chance because I am extraordinary&nbsp;. . . Somebody should write a -biography about me.&#x201d; The median narcissism score has risen 30 percent in the last two decades. Ninety--three percent of young people score higher than the middle score just twenty years ago.4 The largest gains have been in the number of people who agree with the statements &#x201c;I am an extraordinary person&#x201d; and &#x201c;I like to look at my body.&#x201d;<br><br> Along with this apparent rise in self--esteem, there has been a tremendous increase in the desire for fame. Fame used to rank low as a&nbsp;life&#x2019;s ambition for most people. In a 1976 survey that asked people to&nbsp;list their life goals, fame ranked fifteenth out of sixteen. By 2007, 51&nbsp;percent of young people reported that being famous was one of their top personal goals.5 In one study, middle school girls were asked who they would most like to have dinner with. Jennifer Lopez came in first, Jesus Christ came in second, and Paris Hilton third. The girls were then asked which of the following jobs they would like to have. Nearly twice as many said they&#x2019;d rather be a celebrity&#x2019;s personal assistant&#x2014;-for example, Justin Bieber&#x2019;s&#x2014;-than president of Harvard. (Though, to be fair, I&#x2019;m pretty sure the president of Harvard would also rather be Justin Bieber&#x2019;s personal assistant.)<br><br> As I looked around the popular culture I kept finding the same messages everywhere: You are special. Trust yourself. Be true to yourself. Movies from Pixar and Disney are constantly telling children how wonderful they are. Commencement speeches are larded with the same clich�s: Follow your passion. Don&#x2019;t accept limits. Chart your own course. You have a responsibility to do great things because you are so great. This is the gospel of self--trust.<br><br> As Ellen DeGeneres put it in a 2009 commencement address, &#x201c;My advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine.&#x201d; Celebrity chef Mario Batali advised graduates to follow &#x201c;your own truth, expressed consistently by you.&#x201d; Anna Quindlen urged another audience to have the courage to &#x201c;honor your character, your intellect, your inclinations, and, yes, your soul by listening to its clean clear voice instead of following the muddied messages of a timid world.&#x201d;<br> In her mega--selling book <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> (I am the only man ever to finish this book), Elizabeth Gilbert wrote that God manifests himself through &#x201c;my own voice from within my own self. . . . God dwells within you as you yourself, exactly the way you are.&#x201d;6<br><br> I began looking at the way we raise our children and found signs of this moral shift. For example, the early Girl Scout handbooks preached an ethic of self--sacrifice and self--effacement. The chief obstacle to happiness, the handbook exhorted, comes from the overeager desire to have people think about you.<br><br> By 1980, as James Davison Hunter has pointed out, the tone was very different. <i>You Make the Difference: The Handbook for Cadette and -Senior Girl Scouts</i> was telling girls to pay <i>more</i> attention to themselves: &#x201c;How can you get more in touch with <i>you</i>? What are <i>you</i> feeling? . . . Every option available to you through Senior Scouting can, in some way, help you to a better understanding of yourself. . . . Put yourself in the &#x2018;center stage&#x2019; of your thoughts to gain perspective on your own ways of feeling, thinking and acting.&#x201d;7<br><br> The shift can even be seen in the words that flow from the pulpit. Joel Osteen, one of the most popular megachurch leaders today, writes from Houston, Texas. &#x201c;God didn&#x2019;t create you to be average,&#x201d; Osteen says in his book <i>Become a Better You</i>. &#x201c;You were made to excel. You were made to leave a mark on this generation. . . . Start [believing] &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve been chosen, set apart, destined to live in victory.&#x2019; &#x201d;8<br><br>The Humble Path<br><br> As years went by and work on this book continued, my thoughts returned to that episode of <i>Command Performance.</i> I was haunted by the quality of humility I heard in those voices.<br> There was something aesthetically beautiful about the self--effacement the people on that program displayed. The self--effacing person is soothing and gracious, while the self--promoting person is fragile and jarring. Humility is freedom from the need to prove you are superior all the time, but egotism is a ravenous hunger in a small space&#x2014;-self--concerned, competitive, and distinction--hungry. Humility is infused with lovely emotions like admiration, companionship, and gratitude. &#x201c;Thankfulness,&#x201d; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, said, &#x201c;is a soil in which pride does not easily grow.&#x201d;9<br><br> There is something intellectually impressive about that sort of humility, too. We have, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman writes, an &#x201c;almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.&#x201d;10 Humility is the awareness that there&#x2019;s a lot you don&#x2019;t know and that a lot of what you think you know is distorted or wrong.<br><br> This is the way humility leads to wisdom. Montaigne once wrote, &#x201c;We can be knowledgeable with other men&#x2019;s knowledge, but we can&#x2019;t be wise with other men&#x2019;s wisdom.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s because wisdom isn&#x2019;t a body of information. It&#x2019;s the moral quality of knowing what you don&#x2019;t know and figuring out a way to handle your ignorance, uncertainty, and limitation.<br><br> The people we think are wise have, to some degree, overcome the biases and overconfident tendencies that are infused in our nature. In its most complete meaning, intellectual humility is accurate self--awareness from a distance. It is moving over the course of one&#x2019;s life from the adolescent&#x2019;s close--up view of yourself, in which you fill the whole canvas, to a landscape view in which you see, from a wider perspective, your strengths and weaknesses, your connections and dependencies, and the role you play in a larger story.<br><br> Finally, there is something morally impressive about humility. Every epoch has its own preferred methods of self--cultivation, its own ways to build character and depth. The people on that <i>Command Performance</i> broadcast were guarding themselves against some of their least attractive tendencies, to be prideful, self--congratulatory, hubristic.<br><br> Today, many of us see our life through the metaphor of a -journey&#x2014;a journey through the external world and up the ladder of -success. When we think about making a difference or leading a life with purpose, we often think of achieving something external&#x2014;-performing some service that will have an impact on the world, creating a successful company, or doing something for the community.<br><br> Truly humble people also use that journey metaphor to describe their own lives. But they also use, alongside that, a different metaphor, which has more to do with the internal life. This is the metaphor of self--confrontation. They are more likely to assume that we are all deeply divided selves, both splendidly endowed and deeply flawed&#x2014;-that we each hav...</p><h2>The Hammer of God</h2><p>In 2110, when an asteroid enters the solar system on a direct collision course with Earth, it is up to Captain Robert Singh and the crew of the spacecraft Goliath to find a way to avert catastrophe. 100,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo.</p><p>2110 technology has cured&nbsp;&nbsp;most of our worries.

This book is by one of the most important and briliant thinkers at work today.</p><p>William Gass has been a Professor of Philosophy at Purdue University in Indiana and at Washington University in St. Louis, where he is Director of the International Writers Center.These 19 essays showcase precision intellectual workmanship, displaying intricate, multifaceted models of how writing and thinking relate to life. Gass won the 1985 National Book Award for a previous essay collection, Habitations of the Word; most recently he authored an ingenious, gigantic novel, The Tunnel (1995). The essays reprinted here belong to a variety of genres, but all centrally consider how writing enters into the world--how writers find forms adequate for their thoughts. In an opening section Gass takes on several institutions that in his opinion mark today's writing with mediocrity; he dissects the disgraceful track record of the Pulitzer Prize for literature and the inadequacies of the minimalist prose style that emenates from academic fiction-writing programs. His main focus, however, is on conjunctions of writing with philosophy and experience. Gass offers appreciations of favorite modern authors whose works and lives are rich in philosophical meditiation, such as Robert Walser and Danilo Kis; biographical review essays treating the relationship of life to work for Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and Ezra Pound; and digests of intellectual history burdened with such portentous titles as ``Nature, Culture, and Cosmos.'' These latter can suffer from showboating and cutefying. Such faults crop up occasionally even in the best essays here. Gass's postmodern idiom at times leads him to facile would-be cleverness--informing us with regard to Nietzsche, for instance, that ``of course, the superman doesn't sport blue underwear.'' At his best, however, when Gass puts his philosophical bent at the service of his literary gifts, singular insights emerge. This volume's finest essays shed new light on the workings of prose style--on ``the music of prose''--in cases ranging from a lively piece of Middle English sermonizing to the impressionism of Ford Madox Ford. Gass shines when he addresses the subject most befitting a self-described ``Methodologist,'' one ``for whom the medium is the muse''--his own prose medium itself. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In a whole range of issues, Christians search for the biblical answer. But ethics is about far more than controversial issues and hard cases. It&#39;s about how we apply the teaching of the Bible to our lives each day as we wait for Christ&#39;s return; it&#39;s about our actions and our motives; it&#39;s about our character. In this vibrant, stimulating and much-needed book, Michael Hill introduces us to an evangelical approach to ethics. Starting from creation, and taking us through the whole of biblical theology, the author develops a simple and yet comprehensive model of gospel-based ethics. In so doing, he provides us not just with solutions to difficult cases, but with an ethical framework we can bring to every aspect of our lives.</p><p></p><h2>Art of the Third Reich</h2><p>A look at the art of National Socialist Germany explores the events that led to the traditional German style linked to nature, the family, the homeland; the suppression of modern art; and the propaganda tool the art served.</p><p>British filmmaker Peter Adam grew up in Hitler&#39;s Germany. In this important book, now available in paperback for the first time, he presents hundreds of examples of artwork that was officially sanctioned by the Third Reich, and which has not been seen by the public since the 1940s. Many of the illustrations are taken from German publications of the era, and reveal how all of the nation&#39;s arts--including painting, film, and architecture--were methodically manipulated by the regime into tools of Nazi propaganda. Adam&#39;s film documentary of the same name, on which this book is based, received a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Arts Program.A major propaganda tool in spreading Nazi ideology, the official art of Hitler's regime remains virtually hidden from the German public today. Featuring 321 illustrations (including 33 plates in color), this significant survey is a chilling reminder of how art can be used to promote philistine attitudes and to camouflage evil. Adam, a BBC-TV producer raised in Nazi Berlin and of Jewish ancestry, produced an award-winning documentary film on which this book is based. He thoughtfully reviews Nazi artworks--vulgar kitsch at best: statues of men and women conforming to the fantasy of a pure Aryan race, portraits of the Fuhrer, scenes of farm families, messianic dances, recruitment posters and grandiose architectural schemes for redesigning Berlin, Munich and Nuremberg, colossal plans that embody the vapid dreams of a megalomaniac. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Code Name: Johnny Walker: The Extraordinary Story of the Iraqi Who Risked Everything to Fight with the U.S. Navy SEALs</h2><p><p>In this unforgettable memoir, the Navy SEALs&#x2019; most trusted translator&#x2014;a man who is credited with saving countless American lives and became a legend in the special-ops community&#x2014;tells his inspiring story for the first time.</p><p>As the insurgency in Iraq intensified following the American invasion, U.S. Navy SEALs were called upon to root terrorists from their lairs.

He quickly became the most sought-after terp in the country, receiving numerous citations and commendations for his work. Credited by SEAL sniper Chris Kyle with saving countless American lives, Johnny spent six years working with SEALs and other special operations forces throughout Iraq, completing more than one thousand missions. After narrowly escaping two attempts on his life, Johnny was helped to the United States by the SEALs in 2009. He and his family currently live in California, where he helps train special operations units.</p></p><h2>War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America&#39;s Campaign to Create a Master Race</h2><p>In War Against the Weak, award-winning investigative journalist Edwin Black connects the crimes of the Nazis to a pseudoscientific American movement of the early twentieth century called eugenics. Based on selective breeding of human beings, eugenics began in laboratories on Long Island but ended in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. Ultimately, over 60,000 unfit Americans were coercively sterilized, a third of them after Nuremberg declared such practices crimes agains humanity. This is a timely and shocking chronicle of bad science at its worst&#x2014;which holds important lessons for the impending genetic age.</p><p>The plans of Adolf Hitler and the German Nazis to create a Nordic "master race" are often looked upon as a horrific but fairly isolated effort. Less notice has historically been given to the American eugenics movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although their methods were less violent, the methodology and rationale which the American eugenicists employed, as catalogued in Edwin Black's <i>Against the Weak</i>, were chilling nonetheless and, in fact, influential in the mindset of Hitler himself. Funded and supported by several well-known wealthy donors, including the Rockefeller and Carnegie families and Alexander Graham Bell, the eugenicists believed that the physically impaired and "feeble-minded" should be subject to forced sterilization in order to create a stronger species and incur less social spending. These "defective" humans generally ended up being poorer folks who were sometimes categorized as such after shockingly arbitrary or capricious means ! such as failing a quiz related to pop culture by not knowing where the Pierce Arrow was manufactured. The list of groups and agencies conducting eugenics research was long, from the U.S. Army and the Departments of Labor and Agriculture to organizations with names like the "American Breeders Association." Black's detailed research into the history of the American eugenics movement is admirably extensive, but it is in the association between the beliefs of some members of the American aristocracy and Hitler that the book becomes most chilling. Black goes on to trace the evolution of eugenic thinking as it evolves into what is now called genetics. And while modern thinkers have thankfully discarded the pseudo-science of eugenics, such controversial modern issues as human cloning make one wonder how our own era will be remembered a hundred years hence. <i>--John Moe</i>"Edwin Black has again written a unique and important book. Until now eugenics in the U.S. and in Germany have not been analyzed together. One assumed they had little in common. This was not so.

Her numerous books for children include the New York Times bestseller Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes, written by Mem Fox; Kate Greenaway Medal-winning Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (9781406316230); Smarties Book Prize-winning Farmer Duck (9780744536607) by Martin Waddell; We&#39;re Going on a Bear Hunt (9780744523232) by Michael Rosen; as well as her classic board books for babies. She lives in London.Oxenbury brings her considerable talents to bear on this slender but winsome picture book. "It's my birthday and I'm going to make a cake," announces a child, and one by one a host of animal friends offer their contributions--an egg from the chicken, flour from the bear, salt from the pig and so on. Perfectly paced, the story celebrates friendship and ends, naturally, with a party. Like the casts of Else Holmelund Minarik's classic tales, the animals are gently anthropomorphized, and the affection they display toward one another underscores the story's theme. Oxenbury deliberately leaves the child's gender ambiguous, making it all that much easier for every reader to identify with her character. As always, her understated watercolors are filled with whimsy--from a picnicking otter family that lends salt to the pig to a bespectacled sheep at the market cash register--and they shine with the quiet resplendence of happy family life.

It is an excursion into life from the Christian perspective, from the viewpoint of those who set out not only to follow Jesus but to live as Jesus lived and to think as Jesus thought.<br><br>It proposes, year after year, to immerse us over and over again into the sense and substance of the Christian life until, eventually, we become what we say we are-followers of Jesus all the way to the heart of God.

Maybe you should listen to what Dee Dee Ramone has to say first. In Legend of a Rock Star the myth of the rock 'n' roll good life is destroyed once and for all. Touring is hell, and Dee Dee should know, after fifteen plus years with the legendary Ramones, he's back on the road with a new band and a new set of nightmares. Riddled with acerbic hilarity, Legend of a Rock Star offers a fantastic, unflinching look at the abysmal underbelly of the rock &#x2018;n' roll dream as Dee Dee and his new brothers tour Europe in a tiny cramped van and try their best not to kill one another. With shifty promoters out to suck him dry, and fans who mean well but just won't leave him alone, all Dee Dee can do is wrestle with his conscience and hope the drugs aren't bad. Written in a fierce chaotic prose uniquely his own, Dee Dee also offers a brutally honest, yet surprisingly touching account of the weeks leading up to and just after the death of friend and longtime bandmate Joey Ramone.</p><p></p><h2>Essence and Alchemy: A Book of Perfume</h2><p>An artisan perfumer reveals a lost art and its mysterious, sensual history.<br><br>For centuries, people have taken what seems to be an instinctive pleasure in rubbing scents into their skin. Perfume has helped them to pray, to heal, and to make love. And as long as there has been perfume, there have been perfumers, or rather the priests, shamans, and apothecaries who were their predecessors. Yet, in many ways, perfumery is a lost art, its creative and sensual possibilities eclipsed by the synthetic ingredients of which contemporary perfumes are composed, which have none of the subtlety and complexity of essences derived from natural substances, nor their lush histories. <i>Essence and Alchemy</i> resurrects the social and metaphysical legacy that is entwined with the evolution of perfumery, from the dramas of the spice trade to the quests of the alchemists to whom today's perfumers owe a philosophical as well as a practical debt. Mandy Aftel tracks scent through the boudoir and the bath and into the sanctums of worship, offering insights on the relationship of scent to sex, solitude, and the soul. Along the way, she imparts instruction in the art of perfume compositions, complete with recipes, guiding the reader in a process of transformation of materials that continues to follow the alchemical dictum solve et coagula (dissolve and combine) and is itself aesthetically and spiritually transforming.<br></p><p><p>"To this most extraordinary treatise on the history and making of perfume, Aftel... brings sheer delight in the bouquet of aromas in the natural world." --Publishers Weekly</p> <p>"[A] compulsively readable compendium of perfume legend, lore, and instruction." --San Francisco Chronicle</p> <p>For centuries people have taken instinctive pleasure in rubbing scents into their skin, using them to pray, to heal, and to make love and war.

On one side are parents, bombarded with stories about the dangers of vaccines, now wary of immunizing their sons and daughters. On the other side are doctors, scared to send kids out of their offices vulnerable to illnesses like whooping cough and measles--the diseases of their grandparents.<p>How did anyone come to view vaccines with horror? The answer is rooted in one of the most powerful citizen activist movements in our nation's history. In <i>Deadly Choices</i>, infectious disease expert Paul Offit relates the shocking story of anti-vaccine America--its origins, leaders, influences, and impact. Offering strategies to keep us from returning to an era when children routinely died from infections, <i>Deadly Choices</i> is a vigorous and definitive rebuttal of the powerful anti-vaccine movement.</p></p><p><b>Paul A. Offit, MD</b>, is the Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit is a founding advisory board member of the Autism Science Foundation.<p><b>Perri Klass, Professor of Journalism and Pediatrics, New York University; author of </b><i><b>Treatment Kind and Fair</b></i><br> &#x201c;<i>Deadly Choices</i> carries a very important message for parents, journalists, physicians, and everyone who cares about children and health. It is a passionate, but also compassionate, call for civil discourse and rational conversation on a subject which matters so much to each of us individually and to us all as a society. It is a fascinating account of society and science, politics, publicity, and public health.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p><b>David Oshinsky, Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin; author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning </b><i><b>Polio: An American Story</b></i><br> &#x201c;A medical crisis has come to America. Diseases of our grandparents&#x2019; generation are making a deadly comeback as more and more parents choose not to vaccinate their children. How did this happen? Who is responsible? And what can be done to reverse this unconscionable assault upon our nation&#x2019;s public health? For the answers, provided in clear, common sense, page-turning fashion, I recommend <i>Deadly Choices</i> by Dr. Paul Offit&#x2014;a timely and courageous call to arms by the nation&#x2019;s foremost expert on pediatric infectious disease.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Michael Specter, Staff Writer, <i>The New Yorker</i>; author of </b></p><br><br><i><b>Denialism</b></i><br> &#x201c;With <i>Deadly Choices</i>, Paul Offit has once again brought clarity and reason to a subject that desperately needs them both.

Goldberg, Ph.D., Vice President, Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and author of </b><br><br><i><b>Tabloid Medicine: How the Internet is Being Used to Hijack Medical Science for Fear and Profit</b></i><br> &#x201c;This is a courageous book by a courageous researcher and physician. Paul Offit&#x2019;s new book tells the truth about the anti-vaccine movement, its unquestioning followers in the media and about the deadly consequences of their campaign of fear. <i>Deadly Choices</i> demonstrates that the enemies of immunizations are successful because too many of us have remained silent in the face of their falsehoods and intimidation. Dr. Offit shows that by standing up for science we can win the war against those who would leave our children defenseless against infectious disease.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Steven Novella, Assistant Professor and Director of General Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine</b><br> &#x201c;Dr. Offit brings to life in careful and compelling detail the story of misguided and dangerous activists using bad science to attack one of the most effective public health interventions ever devised.

Now Ross focuses on mental strength, stoicism and the training needed to create an unbreakable body.</p><p>Ross Edgley famously ran a marathon pulling a 1.4-tonne car and climbed a rope the height of Everest (8,848m), after living with&nbsp;Yamabushi warrior monks in Japan and partaking in Shamanic pain rituals with fire ants in the Amazon jungle.&nbsp;On his epic 1,780-mile journey around Great Britain, which lasted 157 days, Ross swam through giant jellyfish, arctic storms, &#x2018;haunted&#x2019; whirlpools and polluted shipping lanes, going so hard, and so fast, his tongue fell apart.</p><p>Ross&#x2019;s previous book,&nbsp;<em>The World&#x2019;s Fittest Book</em>, was a <em>Sunday Times</em> No.1 bestseller and explored the science of physical fitness. Now, in&nbsp;<em>The Art of Resilience</em>, Ross uses his swim experience and other amazing endurance feats, where he managed to&nbsp;overcome seemingly insurmountable pain, hardship and adversity, to study the performance of extreme athletes, military and fitness specialists and psychologists to uncover the secrets of mental fitness and explore the concept of resilience, persistence, valour and a disciplined mindset in overcoming adversity.

Drawing on a rich array of sources, the authors interweave the perceptions of medical practitioners, the mentally ill and their families, and journalists, poets, novelists, and artists. As they trace successive ways of explaining madness and treating those judged insane, Gamwell and Tomes vividly depict the political and cultural dimensions of American attitudes toward mental illness.<br>Gamwell and Tomes observe telling differences in the ways in which patients of different genders, races, and classes have been diagnosed and treated. The authors demonstrate how definitions of madness figured in national debates over abolitionism, women's rights, and alternative medicine. Madness in America also considers how the boundaries between sanity and insanity have been repeatedly redrawn in such areas as sexual behavior and criminality.</p><p>Nancy Tomes is Associate Professor of History at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.Tomes (history, Univ. of Stony Brook N.Y.) and Gamwell, director of the Binghamton University Art Museum, have brought into print their 1994 exhibition at the New York Academy of Sciences depicting the treatment of mental illness in the United States from Colonial times to World War I. Contemporary accounts by patients, medical practitioners, artists, and writers are juxtaposed with engravings, artwork, and photographs that illustrate changes through time in the diagnosis and treatment of the insane. Differing causes and cures determined according to race, class, and gender are explored in historical context. Scientific and alternative treatments are described, including hydrotherapy, patent medicines, mesmerism, rest, and talking cures. This volume, its lucid text supplemented by an impressive array of illustrations, provides an important introduction to a timely subject.

Only material authorized for the production of this play may be used</p><p>After the chuckles and amidst the chortles, the first-time reader of <i>The Thurber Carnival</i> is bound to utter a discreetly voiced "Huh?" Like Cracker Jacks, there are surprises inside James Thurber's delicious 1945 smorgasbord of essays, stories, and sketches. This festival is, surprises and all, a collection of earlier collections (mostly), including, among others, gems from <i>My World--and Welcome to It</i>, <i>Let Your Mind Alone!</i>, and <i>The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze</i>. Needless to say, there are also numerous cartoons that, by themselves, are worth the price of admission. While redoubling Thurber's deserved reputation as a laugh-out-loud humorist and teller-of-gentle-tales, it reintroduces him as a thinker-of-thoughts. To wit: his 1933 "Preface to a Life," in which he observes himself while discussing "writers of light pieces running from a thousand to two thousand words": <blockquote> To call such persons "humorists," a loose-fitting and ugly word, is to miss the nature of their dilemma and the dilemma of their nature. The little wheels of their invention are set in motion by the damp hand of melancholy. </blockquote> Enjoy the surprises, certainly, but revel in the candy-coated popcorn and peanuts. As in "More Alarms at Night," in which a teenaged Thurber intrudes upon his sleeping father, a skittish man named Charles, because he can't recall the name Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Coincidentally, his father has just been frightened half to death by Thurber's brother, who had earlier stalked into his room saying coldly, "Buck, your time has come." <blockquote> "Listen," I said. "Name some towns in New Jersey quick!" It must have been around three in the morning. Father got up, keeping the bed between him and me, and started to pull his trousers on. "Don't bother about dressing," I said. "Just name some towns in New Jersey." While he hastily pulled on his clothes--I remember he left his socks off and put his shoes on his bare feet--father began to name, in a shaky voice, various New Jersey cities. I can still see him reaching for his coat without taking his eyes off me. "Newark," he said, "Jersey City, Atlantic City, Elizabeth, Paterson, Passaic, Trenton, Jersey City, Trenton, Paterson--" "It has two names," I snapped. "Elizabeth and Paterson," he said. </blockquote> Of course, things turn out fine, as well they should. And why not? The best of Thurber, which <i>The Thurber Carnival</i> arguably is, is sublime; surprising insight and wry observations tossed lightly and served constantly with effortless good humor and an obvious love for all things gently eccentric. <i>--Michael Hudson</i>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Two Fat Ladies Ride Again</h2><p>They're eccentric, they're outspoken--and they're back, ready for more delicious adventures! Clarissa Dickson Wright and Jennifer Paterson, stars of Food Network's and PBS's hit series <b>The Two Fat Ladies</b>, once again take to their motorcycle and sidecar and serve up rich, delectable dishes in the tradition of their first book, <b>Cooking with the Two Fat Ladies</b>.<br><br>Their irreverent wit and pure, old-fashioned enjoyment of food has won them a devoted audience on both sides of the Atlantic. But they are much more than entertainers, as <b>The Two Fat Ladies Ride Again</b> reaffirms. Packed with more than 120 recipes, from Light Dishes, Starters, and Savories to Picnics, <b>Ride Again</b> rises to the standard set by the Ladies' best-selling first collection. <br><br>Breakfast has never been so lavish as with their Aniseed Waffles, Bread and Butter Pudding, and Red Flannel Hash.

The Ladies laugh in the face of the fat-fearing fanatic and are proud to share such decadent gems as Spare Ribs and Whisky Chocolate Pie.<br><br>Sprinkled throughout are whimsical personal anecdotes and snapshots of the Ladies, inviting all to experience their world of devilish fun and feast. Dickson Wright and Paterson eat and live indulgently and encourage others to do the same, giving&nbsp;&nbsp;readers license to partake in their full-flavored food--and enjoy every delicious moment.</p><p>Streets are shaking and buildings are trembling! This can mean only one thing: the two fat ladies, those disciples of all foods good and forbidden, have returned! No thin stomach is safe from the pleasures of Jennifer Paterson and Clarissa Dickson Wright's 130 titillating new recipes. Even the names ooze joy, wonderment, and yearning--Mrs. Anne Bearley's Rhubarb Whim Wham and Fried Eggs on Puffball Mushrooms, to name but two of these delectable dishes. As in the style of the fat ladies' previous (and wondrous) creation, <i>Cooking with the Two Fat Ladies</i>, witty anecdotes and a uniquely British brand of humor make <i>The Two Fat Ladies Ride Again</i> much more than just a list of recipes. When speaking of pudding (that's dessert to any nonroyal subject), Clarissa writes, "A pudding should be unequivocally a pudding ... at your next dinner party, try serving two puddings, one in my style with cream and meringue and delicious things, and one <i>soi-disant</i> healthy variety, and see which you are left with to carry back to the kitchen." How right she is--foods ooze with richness and high taste. Rigo Jancis Chocolate Slices require not only bittersweet chocolate, but also cocoa powder, eggs, sugar, and heavy, stiffly whipped cream. There are no low-fat yogurt substitutes here! <p> Recipes are neatly and simply categorized as appetizers, main dishes, puddings, and picnic foods--divinely illustrated with full-color photographs. Also included are chapters on the three best times of the day--breakfast time, teatime, and cocktail hour! Meat, game, and fish feature heavily--Beef with Chestnuts, Pears, and Almonds is a particularly succulent Catalonian dish, combining a tasty, tangy fresh sauce to accompany roast beef or steak. These beautiful creations do require a degree of cooking experience, and cannot be whipped up in the microwave. But the rewards are high--delicious, pleasing foods that will nurture the soul. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><br>"Old-fashioned cooks, long on potatoes, short on pretension.

Bernie Gunther, our sardonic former Berlin homicide dick and unwilling SS officer, is the go-to guy at the Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, the man you turn to for touring tips or if you need a fourth for bridge. As it happens, a local writer needs just that, someone to fill the fourth seat in a regular game that is the usual evening diversion at the Villa Mauresque. Not just any writer. Perhaps the most famous living writer in the world: W. Somerset Maugham. <br> And it turns out it is not just a bridge partner that he needs; it's some professional advice. Maugham is being blackmailed--perhaps because of his unorthodox lifestyle. Or perhaps because of something in his past, because once upon a time, Maugham worked for the British Secret Service, and the people now blackmailing him are spies. <br> As Gunther fans know, all roads lead back to the viper's nest that was Hitler's Third Reich and to the killing fields that spread like a disease across Europe. Even in 1956, peace has not come to the continent now that the Soviets also have the H-bomb and spies from every major power feel free to make all of Europe their playground.</p><p><b>Philip Kerr </b>is the author of the widely acclaimed Bernie Gunther novels, including <i>The Other Side of Silence, </i> <i>The Lady From Zagreb, A Man Without Breath</i>, <i> Prague Fatale, </i>and <i>Field Gray, </i>all <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. <i>Field Gray</i>and <i>The Lady From Zagreb </i>were both finalists for Edgar Award for Best Novel. Kerr has also been a finalist for the Shamus Award and the winner of the British Crime Writers' Association Ellis Peters Historical Award. Under the name P. B. Kerr, he is the author of the much-loved young adult series Children of the Lamp. He lives in London.<p><b>Chapter 1: French Riviera 1956</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I tried to kill myself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&#x2019;t that I wanted to die as much as the fact that I wanted the pain to stop. Elisabeth, my wife, left me a while ago and I&#x2019;d been missing her a lot. That was one source of pain, and a pretty major one, I have to admit. Even after a war in which more than four million German soldiers died, German wives are hard to come by. But another serious pain in my life was the war itself of course, and what happened to me back then, and in the Soviet POW camps afterwards. Which perhaps made my decision to commit suicide odd considering how hard it was not to die in Russia; but staying alive was always more of a habit for me than an active choice. For years under the Nazis I stayed alive out of sheer bloody mindedness. So I asked myself, early one Spring morning, why not kill yourself?&nbsp; To a Goethe-loving Prussian like me the pure reason of a question like that was almost unassailable. Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t as if life was so great anymore, although in truth I&#x2019;m not sure it ever was. Tomorrow and the long, long empty year to come after that isn&#x2019;t something of much interest to me, especially down here on the French Riviera. I was on my own, pushing sixty and working in a hotel job that I could do in my sleep, not that I got much of that these days. Most of the time I was miserable. I was living somewhere I didn&#x2019;t belong and it felt like a cold corner in hell, so it wasn&#x2019;t as if I believed anyone who enjoys a sunny day would miss the dark cloud that was my face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was all that for choosing to die, plus the arrival of a guest at the hotel. A guest I recognized and wished I hadn&#x2019;t. But I&#x2019;ll come to him in a moment. Before that I have to explain why I&#x2019;m still here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went into the garage underneath my small apartment in Villefranche, closed the door, and waited in the car with the engine turning over. Carbon monoxide poisoning isn&#x2019;t so bad. You just close your eyes and go to sleep. If the car hadn&#x2019;t stalled or perhaps just run out of gas I wouldn&#x2019;t be here now. I thought I might try it again another time, if things didn&#x2019;t improve and if I bought a more reliable motor car. On the other hand, I could have returned to Berlin, like my poor wife, which might have achieved the same result. Even today it&#x2019;s just as easy to get yourself killed there as it ever was and if I were to go back to the former German capital, I don&#x2019;t think it would be very long before someone was kind enough to organize my sudden death. One side or the other has got it in for me, and with good reason. When I was living in Berlin and being a cop or an ex-cop, I managed to offend almost everyone, with the possible exception of the British. Even so, I miss the city a lot. I miss the beer, of course, and the sausage. I miss being a cop when being Berlin police still meant something good. But mostly I miss the people who were as sour as I am. Even Germans don&#x2019;t like Berliners and it&#x2019;s a feeling that&#x2019;s usually reciprocated. Berliners don&#x2019;t like anyone very much - especially the women, which, somehow, only makes them more attractive to a dumb head like me. There&#x2019;s nothing more attractive to a man than a beautiful woman who really doesn&#x2019;t care if he lives or dies. I miss the women most of all. There were so many women. I think about the good women I&#x2019;ve known - quite a few of the bad ones, too - who I&#x2019;ll never see again and sometimes I start crying and from there it&#x2019;s only a short trip to the garage and asphyxiation, especially if I&#x2019;ve been drinking. Which, at home, is most of the time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I&#x2019;m not feeling sorry for myself I play bridge, or read books about playing bridge, which might strike a lot of people as a pretty good reason on its own to kill yourself. But it&#x2019;s a game I find stimulating. Bridge helps to keep my mind sharp and occupied with something other than thoughts of home - and all those women, of course. In retrospect it seems that a great many of them must have been blondes and not just because they were German, or close to being German. Rather too late in life I&#x2019;ve learned that there&#x2019;s a type of woman I&#x2019;m attracted to, which is the wrong type, and it often happens that this includes a certain shade of hair color that just spells trouble for a man like me. Risky mate search and sexual cannibalism are a lot more common than you might think, although more usual among spiders. Apparently the females assess the nutritional value of a male rather than a male&#x2019;s value as a mate. Which more or less sums up the history of my entire personal life. I&#x2019;ve been eaten alive so many times I feel like I&#x2019;ve got eight legs, although by now it&#x2019;s probably just three or four.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s not much of an insight, I know, and like I say, it hardly matters now, but even if it happens late in life a degree of self-awareness has to be better than none at all. That&#x2019;s what my wife used to tell me, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-awareness certainly worked for her: she woke up one morning and realized just how bored and disappointed she was with me and our new life in France and went back home the very next day. I can&#x2019;t say that I blame her. She never managed to learn French, appreciate the food, or even enjoy the sun very much and that&#x2019;s the only thing down here of which there&#x2019;s a free and plentiful supply. At least in Berlin you always know why you&#x2019;re miserable. That&#x2019;s what Berlin<i> luft</i> is all about; an attempt to try to whistle your way out of the gloom. Here, on the Riviera, you would think there&#x2019;s everything to whistle about and no reason at all to be down in the mouth, but somehow I managed it and she couldn&#x2019;t take that anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I was miserable largely because I&#x2019;m bored as hell. I miss my old detective&#x2019;s life. I&#x2019;d give anything to walk through the doors of the police praesidium on Alexanderplatz - by all accounts it&#x2019;s been demolished by the so-called East Germans, which is to say the communists - and to go upstairs to my desk in the Murder Commission. These days I&#x2019;m a concierge at the Grand Hotel in St. Jean Cap Ferrat. That&#x2019;s a little bit like being a policeman if your idea of being a policeman is directing traffic and I should know. It&#x2019;s exactly thirty-five years since I was first in uniform, on traffic duty at Potsdamer Platz. But I know the hotel business of old; for a while after the Nazis got into power I was the house detective at Berlin&#x2019;s famous Adlon Hotel. Being a concierge is very different to that. Mostly it&#x2019;s about making restaurant reservations, booking taxis and boats, coordinating porter service, shooing away prostitutes - which isn&#x2019;t as easy as it sounds; these days only American women can afford to look like prostitutes - and giving directions to witless tourists who can&#x2019;t read a map and don&#x2019;t speak French. Only very occasionally is there an unruly guest or a theft and I dream of having to assist the local Sur�te to solve a series of daring jewel robberies of the kind I saw in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>To Catch a Thief</i>. Of course, that&#x2019;s all it is; a dream. I wouldn&#x2019;t ever volunteer to help the local police, not because they&#x2019;re French - although that would be a good reason not to help them - but because I&#x2019;m living under a false passport, and not just any false passport, but one that was given to me by none other than Erich Mielke, who is currently the deputy head of the Stasi, the East German Security Police. That&#x2019;s the kind of favor that sometimes comes with a high price tag and, one day, I expect him to come calling to get me to pay it. Which will probably be the day when I have to go on my travels again. Compared to me, the Flying Dutchman was the Rock of Gibraltar. I suspect my wife knew this, since she also knew Mielke and better than me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite where I&#x2019;d go I have no idea although I hear North Africa is accommodating where Germans on a wanted list are concerned. There&#x2019;s a Fabre line boat that sails from Marseilles to Morocco every other day. That&#x2019;s just the sort of thing that a concierge is supposed to know although it&#x2019;s much more likely that there are rather more of the hotel&#x2019;s well-heeled guests who&#x2019;ve fled from Algeria than there are those who want to go there. Since the massacre of Pieds-Noirs civilians at Philippeville last year, the war against the FLN in Algiers isn&#x2019;t going so well for the French and by all accounts the colony is ruled even more harshly than it ever was when the Nazis left it to the tender mercies of the Vichy government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;m not sure if the effortlessly handsome, dark-haired man I saw checking into one of the hotel&#x2019;s best suites the day before I tried to asphyxiate myself was on any kind of wanted list but he was certainly German and a criminal. Not that he looked like anything less affluent than a banker or a Hollywood film producer and he spoke such excellent French that it was probably only me who would have known he was German. He was using the name Harold Heinz Hebel and gave an address in Bonn, but his real name was Hennig, Harold Hennig and during the last few months of the war he&#x2019;d been a captain in the SD. Now in his early forties he wore a fine, gray lightweight suit that had been tailored for him and black, handmade shoes that were as shiny as a new centime. You tend to notice things like that when you&#x2019;re working at a place like the Grand Hotel. These days I can spot a Savile Row suit from the other side of the lobby. His manners were as smooth as the silk Herm�s tie around his neck, which suited him better than the noose it richly deserved. He tipped all of the porters handsomely from a wad of new notes that was as thick as a slice of bread, and after that the boys treated him and his Louis Vuitton luggage with more care than a case of Meissen porcelain. Coincidentally, the last time I&#x2019;d seen him he&#x2019;d also had some expensive luggage with him, filled with valuables he and his boss, the East Prussian <i>Gauleiter</i> Erich Koch, had probably looted from the city. That had been in January 1945, sometime during the terrible Battle of K�nigsberg. He&#x2019;d been boarding the German passenger ship, <i>Wilhelm Gustloff </i>which was subsequently torpedoed by a Russian submarine with the loss of more than nine thousand civilian lives. He was one of the few rats that managed to escape from that particular sinking ship, which was a great pity since he&#x2019;d helped to bring about its destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Harold Hennig recognized me he didn&#x2019;t show it. In our black morning coats, the hotel&#x2019;s desk staff all tend to look the same, of course. There&#x2019;s that and the fact that I&#x2019;m a little heavier now than I was back then, with less hair probably, not to mention a light tan that my wife used to say suited me. For a man who just tried to kill himself I&#x2019;m in remarkably good shape, even though I say so myself. Alice, one of the maids I&#x2019;ve taken a shine to since Elisabeth left, says I could easily pass for a man ten years younger. Which is just as well as I have a soul that feels like it&#x2019;s at least five hundred years old. It&#x2019;s looked into the abyss so many times it feels like Dante&#x2019;s walking stick.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold Hennig looked straight at me, and although I didn&#x2019;t hold his gaze for more than a second or two, there was no need - being an ex-cop, I never forget a face, especially when it belongs to a mass-murderer. Nine thousand people - men and women and a great many children is a lot of reasons to remember a face like Harold Heinz Hennig&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have to admit that seeing him again looking so prosperous and in such rude health left me feeling very depressed. It&#x2019;s one thing to know that there are people like Eichmann and Mengele who got away with the most appalling crimes. It&#x2019;s another thing when several of the victims of a crime were your friends. There was a time when I might have tried to exact some kind of rough justice, but those days are long gone. These days, revenge is something of which my partner and I talk lightly at the end or perhaps the beginning of a game of bridge at La Voile d&#x2019;Or, which is the only other good hotel in Cap Ferrat. I don&#x2019;t even own a gun. If I did I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t be here now. I&#x2019;m a much better shot than I am a driver.</p></p><h2>The Hidden Game of Baseball</h2><p>Long before Moneyball, this book brought sabermetrics-the scientific measurement of baseball-into the popular realm. Whereas it used to be unquestioned that runs batted in, batting average, and pitcher wins were among the most telling of statistics, the sabermetric revolution revealed that subtler measurements such as on-base percentage, wins above replacement, and WHIP (walks and hits per innings pitched) could be used to find value in players. Thorn and Palmer here introduced key measurements and concepts, and they explained and promoted a huge range of considerations that had never been taken seriously and systemically into account by journalists, fans, players, scouts or executives. Their work also made possible much easier comparison of players across eras. The authors also provide the pedigree and history of various concepts and measurements, showing how our understanding of signal and noise in the available data has evolved.</p><p></p><h2>With a Little Help from Our Friends: Creating Community as We Grow Older</h2><p>In this book, an award-winning journalist tells the story of people devising innovative ways to live as they approach retirement, options that ensure they are surrounded by a circle of friends, family, and neighbors.

Harvey presents a scathing critique of the patriarchal distortions in religious history and doctrine that have obscured full knowledge of the Divine Mother, and shows how to reintegrate this vital aspect into the spiritual consciousness of humankind.<br><br><i>The Return of the Mother</i> offers a radical new perspective, balancing the historical overemphasis on transcendence by honoring the immanence of the divine in passionate engagement in the world. Only by cultivating a direct, respectful relationship with the transformative power of the sacred feminine can we alter our disastrous attitude of dissociation from nature, the body, sexuality, and the details of human life, and generate the energy and compassion needed to reverse the course of destruction we have set the planet&#x2013;and all of life&#x2013;hurtling toward.<br><br>In lively question-and-answer sections, Harvey further illuminates these vital issues and takes a strong stand against our dependence on "gurus" and "masters," proposing instead an egalitarian model of spiritual community based on intimate groups of mutually supportive guides and friends. <br><br><i>The Return of the Mother</i> is an eloquent and passionate call for all of us to rediscover and reclaim an authentic and empowering relationship to the divine, and recreate a sacred life-in-the-world.</p><p>Andrew Harvey is a renowned writer, lecturer, and teacher. An Englishman born in India, Harvey was educated at Oxford, and at twenty-one became the youngest fellow in the history of All Soul&#x2019;s College.

But Harvey has broken with her and renounced the idea of spiritual gurus. In this book, he discusses manifestations of the Divine Mother or feminine principle in Hindu, Sufi, Buddhist, and Christian teachings. He believes the next 20 years will determine the fate of life on earth and that "a new spiritual age is potentially dawning for humankind...in which the divine could be present intimately, normally, consciously, in all things and activities...through the grace of the Mother."

Much of the journal deals with China: U.S. policy toward the People's Republic, the relationship between Mao and Stalin, and Salisbury's admiration for Zhou Enlai ("No man I have met in a lifetime has made so deep a mark on me"). The expressed theme of the book is "the virtue and total necessity of reporting the unpopular event at the mostespeciallyat the most difficult touchy moment." In this engrossing memoir, rich in memorable quotes (Nixon is described as "the most complicated, smartest, and stupidest President of our times"), Salisbury reveals how he went about his job and what the ramifications were. 20,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This sequel to the veteran New York Times correspondent's A Journey for Our Times ( LJ 5/1/83) covers the mid-1950s to the present. Salisbury gives a rambling but fascinating account of his experiences among world leaders and colleagues in the press. Although his primary focus is on China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, Salisbury also reflects on the Kennedy assassination, civil rights struggles, Vietnam War protests, and threats to a free press. Most compelling discussing his travels to China and North Vietnam and the controversies he provoked, he also offers another revealing look at the inner workings of the Times .

An expert on abused women, she begins to investigate the notorious case of Becky Burgess and her teenage lover, who are accused of murdering her husband. As Leila is drawn into Becky's life story of ambition and need, she also meets Mary Burke, a respectable cleaning lady who has no place to live. As all three lives intertwine, and their dramas unfold, Marge Piercy probes their minds and hearts, sharing the frustration, rage, determination and joy that thread through every women's life.</p><p>From the veteran Piercy (He, She, and It, 1991, etc.): an old- fashioned heartwarmer with a feminist agenda and a leavening of schmaltz that'll get the hankies out for a sentimental cry along the way. Set in Boston and environs, the story begins in late October as three disparate women whose longings for the ordinary (decent homes, faithful husbands, better lives) have been thwarted by men each confront an approaching crisis. Leila Landsman, who writes about abused women, fears that her long marriage to theater director Nick is again in trouble; Mary Burke, a former suburban matron turned homeless housecleaner, worries about surviving the winter; and Becky Burgess, daughter of a poor fisherman, is in prison awaiting trial for the murder of her husband. In turns, the women recall their pasts as they deal with the present. Leila, realizing that philandering Nick will never change, prepares for divorce. She has also agreed to write a book about Becky's upcoming trial--which leads us to Becky and nice young Sam, her reluctant partner in crime. Sam's uncle Zak, initially hostile to Leila, soon becomes her lover; he is also a veterinarian, useful for kind Leila's coterie of stray cats. Ambitious Becky, who worked and schemed to improve her life, married Terry because he seemed to have everything she wanted--until he lost his job and found another woman. A fighter to the end, though found guilty, she plans her escape. And Mary, who cleans Leila's house and is the least convincing of the trio, remembers how her life was destroyed when her husband left her; she's injured in a fire, then is saved by Leila, who sends her to live with sister Debbie in sunny California. Leila, though now living alone, rejoices: ``at last I am my own woman.'' Despite some unnecessary speechifying on the big issues: a gripping and affecting story, dominated by Becky, a real original. (First printing of 75,000) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Piercy is an involving and satisfyingly concrete writer, whether she's writing about a post-nuclear holocaust future in <i>He, She and It</i> or this novel's trio of tough-minded women. Leila is the linchpin. A tall, full-bodied professor and author who writes about grave topics such as incest or how women cope with imprisonment, she is the major breadwinner in her household. Husband Nick is in theater. He usually stages plays close to home in the Boston-Cambridge area but periodically goes on the road and, just as often, acquires a young, svelte actress to keep him company. Leila, loving and faithful to a fault, has had enough. Just as she realizes that her cat is far better company than her selfish mate, her agent offers her a lucrative deal on a book about a sensational murder trial. Enter Becky Souza Burgess who is accused of enlisting her teenage lover's help in beating her husband to death. Becky grew up very poor and very determined to improve her lot in life. The first in her large family to make it to college, her dream is to be a TV anchorwoman, but instead, her broadcast debut is as a murder suspect. The third woman in this compelling, well-constructed novel is Mary, a grandmother who, after a brutal divorce late in life, landed on the streets. She works as a cleaning woman and can still "pass" as middle class but is, in fact, homeless. Mary has developed extraordinary strategies for staying alive, but clearly, her position is precarious. As Piercy draws us into the alarming predicaments of each of these women, she traces the progress of their struggles to earn respect and love with unerring accuracy and discernment.

She is also determined that her daughter Grace, born in China, regain some of the culture she lost when the Arringtons brought her to America as a baby. In the university town of Tai&#39;an, a small city where pigs&#39; hooves are available at the local supermarket, donkeys share the road with cars, and the warm-hearted locals welcome this strange looking foreign family, the Arringtons settle in . . . but not at first. Aminta teaches at the university, not realizing she is countering the propaganda the students had memorized for years. Her creative, independent (and loud) American children chafe in their classrooms, the first rung in society&#39;s effort to ensure conformity. The family is bewildered by the seemingly endless cultural differences they face, but they find their way. With humor and unexpectedly moving moments, Aminta&#39;s story is appealingly reminiscent of Reading Lolita in Tehran. It will rivet anyone who is thinking of adopting a child, or anyone who is already familiar with the experience. An everywoman with courage and acute cultural perspective, Aminta recounts this transformative quest with a freshness that will delight anyone looking for an original, accessible point of view on the new China.</p><p>Aminta Arrington has an M.A. in international relations from the John Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

The nervous president, who, an assistant later said, "wanted to know what they thought," and the awed students talked amiably for a time, and then all concerned went about their business, Nixon conducting a war, the students trying to end it. So reported Dan Oberdorfer for the <i>Washington Post</i> in one of the dozens of stories, profiles, articles, and dispatches collected in this volume of Vietnam War-era journalism, the second of two content-packed books in a Library of America set. Among the many highlights of the second volume are reports by <i>New York Times</i> correspondent Sydney Schanberg (of <i>The Killing Fields</i> fame) on the deadly aftermath of the American invasion of Cambodia; Seymour Hersh's coverage of the My Lai massacre, in which American soldiers under the command of Lt. William Calley killed 109 South Vietnamese civilians; U.S. Senator John McCain's account for <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> of his six years as a prisoner of war; and, for a weird home-front spin, Hunter S. Thompson's hallucinogen-fueled reportage from the 1972 Democratic National Convention. The complete text of Michael Herr's <i>Dispatches</i>, an influential and estimable book, is included, as well.

He had traveled throughout Europe, been sold as a war captive in Turkey, escaped, and returned to England in time to join the Virginia Company's colonizing project. In Jamestown migrants, merchants, and soldiers who had also sailed to the distant shores of the Ottoman Empire, Africa, and Ireland in search of new beginnings encountered Indians who already possessed broad understanding of Europeans. Experience of foreign environments and cultures had sharpened survival instincts on all sides and aroused challenging questions about human nature and its potential for transformation. </p><p>It is against this enlarged temporal and geographic background that Jamestown dramatically emerges in Karen Kupperman's breathtaking study. Reconfiguring the national myth of Jamestown's failure, she shows how the settlement's distinctly messy first decade actually represents a period of ferment in which individuals were learning how to make a colony work. Despite the settlers' dependence on the Chesapeake Algonquians and strained relations with their London backers, they forged a tenacious colony that survived where others had failed. Indeed, the structures and practices that evolved through trial and error in Virginia would become the model for all successful English colonies, including Plymouth.</p><p>Capturing England's intoxication with a wider world through ballads, plays, and paintings, and the stark reality of Jamestown--for Indians and Europeans alike--through the words of its inhabitants as well as archeological and environmental evidence, Kupperman re-creates these formative years with astonishing detail.</p></p><p>Karen Ordahl Kupperman is Silver Professor of History at New York University.Reviewed by Tony Horwitz<p>All memory is selective, for nations as for individuals. The year 1620 is etched into Plymouth Rock and the minds of most Americans as the birth date of this country. We hallow austere Pilgrims with a day of national gluttony. The Mayflower is iconic -- the name of a moving company, a luxury Washington hotel, and a recent best-seller.</p><p>But can you name the three ships that landed English colonists 13 years before the Pilgrims? Identify one person aboard, other than John Smith? Explain why they came and what happened to them?</p><p>Jamestown's 400th birthday arrives this year with a fleet of books to stir Americans from their historical amnesia. This awakening should be a snap. The saga of early Virginia has knights, knaves, shipwrecks, naked Indian dancers (cooing to sex-starved Englishmen, "Love you not me?" ),and plenty of smoking and drinking. It's pulp nonfiction compared to the family-friendly tale of pious Pilgrims dining with gentle Indians.</p><p> But the tawdry side of Jamestown also helps explain why its founding has rarely been enshrined as the nativity of English America. As Karen Ordahl Kupperman observes in The Jamestown Project, "This is the creation story from hell." Instead of Thanksgiving, there's the spectacle of starved colonists eating rats, shoes, excrement and each other. One man even killed, carved up and salted his pregnant wife. He was promptly tortured and executed, like many others at Jamestown, a settlement plagued by crime, mutiny and indolence. Rather than grow food, colonists extorted it from Indians. The English ultimately thrived by exporting tobacco and importing Africans. Small wonder that Americans have traditionally abridged Jamestown's story to a single scene: Pocahontas's romantic rescue of John Smith.</p><p> Several new Jamestown books provide a much fuller and less sanitized picture. Together, they tell an epic of suffering -- by English, Indians and Africans -- that was fateful not only to the survival of a colonial fort but to the character of a future nation. Unfortunately, none of these books is likely to excite interest in Jamestown to match that aroused for Plymouth by Nathaniel Philbrick's Mayflower. The Pilgrims, for now, appear safe atop their undeserved perch.</p><p> Kupperman, a historian at New York University and author of several fine books on early America, looks across centuries and continents to set Virginia in context as just one among dozens of colonial ventures. Her wide-angle approach illuminates the roots of European expansion and shows how colonization was understood by both the intruders and the intruded-upon. But it drains Jamestown's story of color and tension. Two hundred pages elapse before Kupperman starts narrating the events that followed the colonists' arrival in Virginia in 1607. Her retelling is tepid, as is her conclusion: "The key to building English societies abroad, however messy and incomplete, was discovered in Virginia and all successful colonies henceforth followed its model." </p><p>As its title suggests, Benjamin Woolley's Savage Kingdom (forthcoming in April) wants to grab the general reader by the throat. If Kupperman's book suffers from too little drama, Woolley's has too much. "On a cold January day in 1606, a messenger walked inconspicuously across the cobbles of London's Strand," a typical chapter opens. The short walk, we're told, was a journey that "crossed from one era of history to another." Only later do we learn the messenger's mission: delivering a dry document about the financing of colonization.</p><p> Woolley, a London-based journalist, has done prodigious research. But too often he improves on it, not only by injecting doubtful atmospherics but also by papering over critical historical questions. John Smith wrote several different versions of his capture by Indians and rescue by Pocahontas, casting doubt on the story's veracity and on Smith as a narrator generally. Woolley blends Smith's various accounts to give us the legendary tale, as if told by the captain around a campfire. He doesn't disclose this cut-and-paste job, except in an oblique footnote. Nor does he examine the meaning of the rescue or analyze almost any aspect of Jamestown's history -- a messy chronicle that cries out for authorial guidance.</p><p> Tim Hashaw provides plenty of direction in The Birth of Black America, which tells of the "Black Mayflower" that brought Africans to Jamestown in 1619. Shipped from Angola, then pirated from a Portuguese slaver, the Africans faced a mixed future in Virginia, which hadn't yet codified slavery. Some were enslaved for life; others became indentured servants, like poor whites, laboring for a term of years before winning back their freedom. A few eventually prospered; one family founded a large property called Angola.</p><p> Hashaw, an investigative journalist, makes the most of the scant material on Virginia's first Africans. But he dilutes this neglected story by chasing after a big-time scoop, alleging a conspiracy tying the Africans' arrival to the Pilgrims' departure. His detective work is hard to follow and detracts from the tragedy and import of the Black Mayflower. Just a month before the Africans were sold near Jamestown, colonists gathered to form the first representative assembly in English America. Already, in 1619, a year before the Pilgrims landed, America's founding flaw was evident. A society built on the contrary pillars of freedom and bondage was destined to fracture.</p><p> Jamestown was also seminal to the future nation because it unleashed one of the most exceptional and prophetic figures in American history. John Smith claimed that he "loved actions more then wordes," but 800 pages of the latter are collected in a mammoth volume from the Library of America that includes his writings, as well as other early narratives of English settlements.</p><p> Here you can read not only about Pocahontas -- whom Smith, contrary to Disney's Barbie-doll animation, described as "a child of tenne yeares olde" -- but also about the captain's incredible adventures on four continents. By the time he sailed for America, at the age of 27, Smith had roamed Europe, Asia and Africa as a mercenary, hermit, slave, pirate, fireworks expert and gladiator.</p><p> Smith was also a vivid writer, hurling invective at the English gentry ("Gluttonous Loyterers," "Tuftaffaty humorists," "tender educats") and delivering proto-American aphorisms ("who would not work must not eat"). But Smith's greatest contribution was his vision of "abounding America" as a land of opportunity for striving immigrants. "Here every man may be master of his owne labour and land," Smith wrote, so long as settlers were willing to work patiently at humble tasks such as farming and fishing. The first to heed his advice were the Pilgrims, who settled a region Smith had scouted six years before the Mayflower's landing and had christened "New England." </p><p>Extracting the gems from Smith's writing requires patient labor, too. His prose is disorganized, his elliptical sentences impossible to parse, and his spelling and syntax so erratic that English can seem a foreign language. The Library of America doesn't help; like its other compilations, this one has no introduction, and the textual notes are stuck at the back. For readers with access to a good library, Philip Barbour's well-annotated, three-volume The Complete Works of Captain John Smith (1986) remains the gold standard. Alternatively, there are short anthologies, including The Journals of Captain John Smith (new this year and edited by John Thompson) and Kupperman's Captain John Smith (1988), which is excellently edited and introduced.</p><p> Still, it's handy to have Smith's complete writing in one volume, and the Library of America edition also includes the best dispatches by other early English settlers in Virginia. These accounts, like Smith's, convey the rich and under-appreciated story of pre-Mayflower America. But the captain deserves the last word. "I would yet begin againe with as small meanes as I did at first," he wrote in 1624, as others followed the path he'd pioneered. "For all their discoveries," he observed, "are but Pigs of my owne Sow." </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

David Abulafia&#39;s The Great Sea is the first complete history of the Mediterranean, from the erection of temples on Malta around 3500 BC to modern tourism. Ranging across time and the whole extraordinary space of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Jaffa, Genoa to Tunis, and bringing to life pilgrims, pirates, sultans and naval commanders, this is the story of the sea that has shaped much of world history.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> In this expansive yet detailed historical gem, David Abulafia covers the full course of human history on the Mediterranean. Beginning more than 20,000 years ago with Cro-Magnon cave dwellers on Gibraltar and stretching to the present, Abulafia treats the Great Sea as &#x201c;the Liquid Continent,&#x201d; a place peopled and traveled&#x2014;where trade, cultural exchange, and empire-building were forces as key to life as currents, tides, and weather patterns. The book deftly illustrates how the Mediterranean was always big enough to keep cultures apart, thus allowing them the space to flourish as unique entities, but that it was never so big that differing cultures couldn&#x2019;t interact. The result is an epic story of trade and conflict, showing how differences in language, religion, law, and other human flashpoints sparked so much of what we think of today simply as <em>culture</em>. --<em>Chris Schluep</em> <p></p> <strong><br>Amazon Exclusive: Author Q&amp;A with David Abulafia</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author David Abulafia</td> </tr> <tr> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What role did Greek mythology and Homeric poetry play in creating a lasting conception of the Mediterranean?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The seas described in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> are a strange amalgam of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, of east and west. Circe the sorceress seems to live in the east, where the sun rises, while Scylla and Charybdis are often identified with the straits between Sicily and mainland Italy.</p> <p>Despite those muddles, Homer does provide fascinating testimony to knowledge of the seas among the Greek colonists in Ionia (what is now eastern Turkey), whose dialect was the basis of Homeric Greek. He knew about Phoenician sailors and was not very complimentary about them. Above all, he placed Odysseus' kingdom at the western limits of Greece, on Ithaka, which he portrayed as an island where it was natural to know how to handle boats. What we see is a dawning conception of the extent of the Mediterranean and of the importance of the sea to the early Greeks.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Beyond the historical, military significance of the Mediterranean, what happened culturally that we tend to overlook?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The Mediterranean has been a meeting place of many different ethnic and religious groups, inhabiting its shores and islands--in remote antiquity, Greeks, Etruscans, Phoenicians; in later centuries, Jews, Christians and Muslims. Gathering in the port cities around the Mediterranean, such as ancient Marseilles, medieval Palermo and Alexandria, modern Livorno and Smyrna, these groups have interacted not just at the level of high culture but in everyday life. On the one hand you have the transmission of medical and astronomical knowledge from east to west in the Middle Ages, often via Muslim and Christian Spain, and on the other hand you have the peaceful interaction of traders and sailors doing business and respecting one another in the great ports of the Mediterranean. Often they were able to cross the boundaries between warring competitors for control of the sea, moving between Christian and Muslim lands under the protection of local rulers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Americans and Europeans have vastly different conceptions of the Mediterranean Sea, with most Americans thinking of the Sea and its shores primarily for its appeal as a tourist destination. What role, if any, has the Mediterranean had in shaping the United States?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The American involvement in the Mediterranean at the start of the nineteenth century is a fascinating story--not just an episode but something that decisively altered the Mediterranean world. By defeating the rulers of the Barbary regencies (Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli), who detained their trading ships and sailors and demanded extortionate sums of money for their release, the American navy helped clear the Mediterranean of the five-century-long scourge of piracy. This was the first foreign war of the United States after independence, and it was now that the U.S. Navy came into existence. In the 20th century, the strategic significance of the Mediterranean in the Cold War brought the U.S.A.F. to Wheelus airfield in Libya and the conflict between Israel and its neighbors has also brought the U.S. Navy into the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean has remained important to the U.S., as we see from the latest events in Libya.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the Mediterranean continue to play a key role in the global economy of the 21st century?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Much depends on the relationship between northern and southern Europe, and between Europe and North Africa. With the Greek economy in desperate straits and the Italian and Spanish economies under severe strain, and with the Arab countries in turmoil, there is a big question mark over the assumption that rapid economic growth will continue in the region. One solution may be to build closer bonds between northern and southern Mediterranean countries, including free trade concessions to Tunisia and Libya. Tunisia possessed the strongest economy in Africa and it would be a disaster to ignore its great economic potential. Another question arises over Chinese investment and involvement in the Mediterranean, which has begun to accumulate. So we are looking at a particularly uncertain future.</p>David Abulafia is Professor of Mediterranean History at the University of Cambridge, and a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, and was until recently Chairman of the Cambridge History Faculty.

The text complements the jewelry in precision, if not in whimsy or beauty. Aimed at cognoscenti of the gem and jewelry world, the text slows down only slightly when introducing more rarified vocabulary: "Enameling ... not only added color to a piece of jewelry but, with the further development of plique-�-jour, its see-through appearance replaced large sections of metal, creating a gossamer look."

I. Gurdjieff, an association that lasted from 1917 through 1929. Our Life with Mr Gurdjieff is essential reading for all those interested in Gurdjieff&#39;s Work or in understanding his unique and revolutionary way of working with his students. Gurdjieff first came to wide public notice in Europe in the 1920s. But, in certain notable circles, his reputation was already legendary. The de Hartmanns met him in Russia in 1917. Following him from Petrograd to Constantinople, Berlin, and Paris, they endured war and revolution, privation and illness, but never wavered in their devotion to his teaching. When they later emigrated to the United States, they became founding members of the Gurdjieff Foundation in America. After Thomas de Hartmann&#39;s death, his wife published his book, Our Life with Mr Gurdjieff, a richly informative and very personal evocation of what it meant to be pupils of Gurdjieff. The present edition has been fully revised and substantially expanded from memoirs of Olga de Hartmann.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Shack</h2><p><b>After his daughter's murder, a grieving father confronts God with desperate questions -- and finds unexpected answers -- in this riveting and deeply moving #1 <i>NYT</i> bestseller.</b><b></b><b><br></b>When Mackenzie Allen Phillips's youngest daughter Missy is abducted during a family vacation, he remains hopeful that she'll return home.

Moments away from the shores of Spain, the boat capsizes and the passengers are forced to swim for their lives, and their freedom. What follows is an exploration of the pasts that led to this passage, and the futures that emerge from this voyage. <p> Less a novel than a series of biographical sketches, the book seems at times like a tease; Lalami does such a beautiful job creating her characters that readers will undoubtedly be left wanting more. Still, each portrait gives us a chance to not only engage with the character, but to gain an understanding of the religious, socio-economic, and emotional circumstances that compel each person to leave Morocco. Faten, a student who dons the <i>hijab</i>, is forced to flee when her religious beliefs start threatening the lives of influential educators. Murad, a serious, educated young man chances the crossing in search of a better life, where he doesn't have to hustle tourists to make a living. In each scene, Lalami bring Moroccan culture to life, from the tree-lined suburbs of Rabat to the Douar Lhajja slum, "where couscous pots were used as satellite dishes." </p><p> With <i>Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits</i>, Lalami creates a world that is both modern and traditional, hopeful and desperate, mournful and joyous.

Born in the late 1800s into a humble world of dirt roads and telegraphs, Powel and Lewis Crosley were opposites in many ways but shared drive, talent, and an unerring knack for knowing what Americans wanted. Their pioneering inventions &#x2014; from the first mass-produced economy car to the push-button radio &#x2014; and breakthroughs in broadcasting and advertising made them both wealthy and famous, as did their ownership of the Cincinnati Reds. But as their fortunes grew, so did Powel&#x2019;s massive ego, which demanded he own eight mansions and seven yachts at the height of the Great Depression. Rich with detailed reminiscences from surviving family members, <i>Crosley</i> is both a powerful saga of a heady time in American history and an intimate tale of two brilliant brothers navigating triumph and tragedy.</p><p></p><h2>The Gourmet Butcher&#39;s Guide to Meat: How to Source it Ethically, Cut it Professionally, and Prepare it Properly (with CD)</h2><p><p>Vermont-based master butcher Cole Ward delivers a comprehensive guide to whole-animal butchery that goes beyond conventional &#x201c;do-it-yourself&#x201d; books and takes readers inside the world of truly sustainable meat production. <em>The Gourmet Butcher's Guide to Meat </em>demystifies the process of getting meat to the table, and its wide scope will be welcome to those who not only wish to learn the rudiments of butchery, but also want to understand how meat animals are raised, slaughtered, and marketed in a holistic system that honors both animals and consumers.<br> <br> Written in Cole&#x2019;s unique voice of humor and simplicity, the book celebrates the traditional art of culinary butchery, introducing readers to stand-out butchers in America and Europe as well as a diverse group of farmers committed to raising the very best animals with respect.<br> <br> The many methods of raising and finishing meat animals are clearly and thoroughly explained and compared, and sensitive issues like hormone and antibiotic use in meat production are assessed.

At the age of fourteen he began working part-time for a local butcher, washing meat trays and stuffing sausages for 20 cents a hour. At fifteen, he became an apprentice meat cutter at the local IGA, and in very few years was a master butcher specializing in whole-animal culinary butchery. In his early twenties, wanderlust took him out west to a job at LaFrieda Prime Meats at Los Angeles&#x2019;s celebrated farmers' market. The famous butcher shop was next to CBS studios, and Ward&#x2019;s celebrity clients soon included Billy Crystal, Bernadette Peters, Perry Como, Edith Head, and Raymond Burr. He also did meat props and special set-ups for television sitcoms like <em>Three&#x2019;s Company</em>.<br> <br>In 1982, Cole returned to Vermont, where most of his large family lives. He worked in markets and supermarkets around the state, managed meat departments, and eventually began giving workshops and doing on-farm cutting. Now Cole mixes hands-on butchering with teaching; his encyclopedic knowledge of the meat sector makes him a sought-after lecturer and seminar leader at culinary academies, colleges, and agricultural and sustainable-living conferences. His full butchery course was recently released on the two DVD set <em>The Gourmet Butcher</em>. With the publication of this book, he is sharing the knowledge acquired over forty-five years of butchering. He is convinced that the more people know about where their meat comes from, the more control they will have over their own and their family&#x2019;s health.</p><p><em><strong>Library Journal-</strong></em></p> <p>"For old-world experience of the art of butchery, look no further than master butcher and lecturer Ward. His deep knowledge shines as he delves into nearly every aspect of butchery&#x2015;from its role in ancient Egypt to profiles of individual farmers and shops to the controversy around ritual slaughter&#x2015;before ever addressing how to carve up a carcass. While parts of this background are compelling, especially Ward&#x2019;s personal story, those looking for practical instructions will have a 100-page wait. Once there, however, readers are greeted with detailed, well-organized information on choosing and processing the best beef, pork, lamb, and chicken. A CD is included for most of the carving instruction. Sensitive readers be warned: like a well-seasoned piece of meat, Ward&#x2019;s language is mildly salty. �<strong>VERDICT</strong>&nbsp;With artisan meat and home butchery growing in popularity among DIYers and urban homesteaders, this book is on trend. However, its detailed emphasis on theory and history make it better suited to the serious gourmet than to the casual foodie.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Booklist-</strong></em></p> <p>"Resolutely carnivorous, Ward amasses evidence confirming that humans have been meat eaters from early in their history. He passionately defends humane animal husbandry, maintaining that properly slaughtered and processed animals produce superior meat. Ward has little use for high-volume, big-business meat packers. Addressing beef, pork, lamb, and chicken, he inventories some of currently popular animal breeds whose flesh offers exceptional flavors. Ward explains how to break down an animal&#x2019;s primal cuts to produce roasts, steaks, and chops, and he offers some unique recipes for sausages. A bibliography gives sources for further exploration, and a CD supplements the book with step-by-step instructional photos.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Cole Ward has done an extraordinary job of balancing the widely diverse components of meat production, marketing, and quality in this comprehensive and uniquely informative book. The author has taken every effort to present even the most contentious issues surrounding meat production from a balanced and accurate perspective. &nbsp;His thorough treatment of these issues provides the reader the opportunity to make a well-informed decision as a matter of personal choice, unencumbered by emotion or innuendo.</p> <p>However, the real value of the book is in the articulate way Ward connects the reader to both the science and the artisanship of gourmet butchering. His comfortable style and incomparable knowledge of gourmet butchering make this a valuable resource for quality meat aficionados and a must read for chefs, butchers, and meat-lovers everywhere.&#x201d;<strong>--Mark Boggess, PhD, animal scientist and meat industry expert</strong></p><br><br><p>"This comprehensive book is far more than a guide to cutting meat&#x2015;it&#x2019;s for anyone who wants a better understanding of meat (and we all should). Engaging, informative, and, yes, fun!"<strong>--Nicolette Hahn Niman, rancher and author, <em>Righteous Porkchop: Finding a Life and Good Food Beyond Factory Farms</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Is there a bible of meat? There is one now. Cole Ward's book demystifies the whole process of how animals are raised, slaughtered, and eventually make it to your plate. From learning about breeds to cutting up your own side of beef, you will be a more empowered meat eater once you read this book."<strong>--Rebecca Thistlethwaite, author, <em>Farms with a Future</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;After nearly forty years of concentrating, industrializing, and deskilling the livestock and meat industries, a few global meat companies have separated the eater from the farmer, land, communities, and animals that we depend on for food. Cole Ward helps restore the lost craftsmanship of meat production by sharing critical knowledge about where meat comes from and&nbsp;how it's produced, processed, and marketed. His book takes the reader on an important journey from animal husbandry through the fading art of butchery to recipes for preparing a healthy meal, all interwoven with explanatory pictures, notes, and interesting trivia.&#x201d;<strong>--Mike Callicrate, owner, Callicrate Cattle Company and Ranch Foods Direct</strong></p></p><h2>Moebius Arzach 1</h2><p>Arzach, a pterodactyl-riding warrior, fights to rid his world of evil enchanter Saukin.</p><p></p><h2>The House at Saltwater Point (A Lavender Tides Novel)</h2><p><p><strong>This&nbsp;<em>USA TODAY&nbsp;</em>bestselling romantic suspense spans from international terrorism to the peaceful lavender fields of Puget Sound in a thrilling race to uncover the truth before it&#x2019;s too late.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ellie Blackmore is making a name for herself as a house flipper.

(<i>Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>Murder Boogies with Elvis</h2><p><p> The Southland's most mismatched set of siblings -- flamboyant Mary Alice and prim and proper Patricia Anne -- are back and ready to boogie in a King-sized story of hip-shaking mayhem and murder most tacky.</p><p>At an age when most women are slowing down, oversized, over-the-top Mary Alice a.k.a. "Sister" -- is always on the lookout for the next good time...and the next husband. Now Sheriff Virgil Stuckey is in line to become Sister's Mister Number Four, which has practical Patricia Anne's level head filling to the brim with a million and one prewedding details. But first there is another important occasion the sisters are looking forward to attending: a gala benefit to raise money for restoring one of Birmingham's unnatural wonders, a towering metal monument to the god Vulcan lately fallen into disrepair.</p><p>The grand finale is thirty sequined Elvis impersonators high kicking in unison. Enjoying the show from the front row, Patricia Anne and Mary Alice are in the line of fire when one of the dancing Kings keels over dead right into the bandstand. It seems this Elvis clone, one Griffin Mooncloth, has not only left the building ... he's left this life!</p><p>At first the sisters figure that the cause of death was a massive heart attack induced by one too many pelvic gyrations. But the unfortunate Mooncloth's very dramatic demise is soon discovered to be the result of a switchblade knife plunged into his back. The plot thickens when the murder weapon is discovered in Patricia Anne's very sensible purse. The perennially law-abiding "Mouse" is understandably all shook up -- and mortified to find herself the prime suspect in this bizarre case of Elvis elimination. And with Mary Alice's well-coiffed head in a sunflower-yellow-and-magenta cloud over her impending nuptials, Patricia Anne's the one who will have to get herself out of very hot water indeed.</p></p><p>Anne George (c.____ - 2001) was the Agatha Award-winning author of the <em>Southern Sisters</em> mystery series which culminate in <em>Murder Boogies with Elvis</em>, publishing in August 2001. Like Patricia Anne, she was a happily married former school teacher living in Birmingham, Alabama. Ms. George was also a former Alabama State Poet and a regular contributor to literary publications. During her lifetime she was nominated for several awards, including the Pulitzer. Being a true lady of the Old South, her date of birth will forever be a mystery.Y'all want lots of good laughs with a grisly murder and some clever detecting thrown in? Join the sexagenarian southern sisters, Mary Alice, a six-footer, and Patricia Anne, a size-six petite. In their eighth adventure from Agatha-winner George (Murder on a Girls' Night Out; Murder on a Bad Hair Day; etc.), Mary Alice, survivor of three marriages, is about to wed her fourth husband, Virgil Stukey, sheriff of Alabama's St. Clair County. At a benefit at a restored theater, a chorus line of Elvis impersonators performs in white jumpsuits; 30 Elvises boogie to the footlights and acknowledge the applause, but only 29 withdraw. One pitches headfirst into the pit, landing only a few feet from the sisters, who have come to cheer for Virgil and his brother-in-law, both Elvis impersonators who just happen to have been on either side of the dead "pitcher." Several days later Patricia Anne, rummaging in her purse, finds a large, rusty switchblade, which turns out to be the murder weapon. She goes to jail. The complications in this delectable tale are legion. The dialogue is so true and natural that it could go straight to stage or film. Inspired name choices include the sisters Dawn, Day and Dusk, as well as a lad called Pukey Lukey (because he's subject to motion sickness). If you're not already a fan, you'll want to find the earlier books, especially since the author died in March. Angels are laughing with her now for the joy she gave so many.

Putney has won dazzling praise from reviewers and readers across the country. Her spellbinding new romantic fantasy will sweep you from Wales&#x2019;s mysterious forests to the glittering menace of Georgian London&#x2013;and into a shattering rendezvous with fate.<br><br>Heir to an ancient title, Simon Malmain, the Earl of Falconer, is well known among the Guardians, humans with magical powers derived from nature. Well known, but not always well loved . . . for those who enforce the law are rarely embraced by those whom they protect&#x2013;and this is equally true whether the law is magical or mundane. <br><br>A routine mission to confront a rogue Guardian who has misused his powers turns disastrous when Simon&#x2019;s quarry, Lord Drayton, captures his pursuer in a transformation spell that can only be released by Drayton&#x2013;or death. Aid arrives in the form of Meg, a fey young woman who first traps Simon, then frees him.<br><br>As they flee together, Simon recognizes that Meg is also a victim of Drayton&#x2019;s evil enchantments, and he restores her nature and innate magic. Though her memory is still clouded, she is freed at last from a shadowy world of fear and lost identity. She agrees to help Simon bring down Drayton. <br><br>The need for each other&#x2019;s magic binds them together&#x2013;and releases the more ancient magic of passion. But desire cannot be satisfied until the rogue mage is stopped. For Drayton has a diabolical plan that will profoundly alter the course of Britain&#x2019;s future. Even the combined power of Simon and Meg may not be enough to stave off catastrophe. Only a desperate act of love may win back the future&#x2013;or destroy all they hold dear.</p><p>A lifelong reader of science fiction and fantasy, M. J. PUTNEY can still quote Robert Heinlein with no encouragement whatsoever. A graduate of Syracuse University with degrees in eighteenth-century literature and industrial design, she followed a peripatetic path to success as a writer. Now a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Publishers Weekly bestselling author, Putney has been a nine-time finalist in the Romance Writers of America RITA contests and has won two RITAs for her historical novels. Her books have been listed four times by the American Library Association among the top five romances of the year. The chance with Stolen Magic to combine fantasy with her love of history and romance is an example of real-life magic in action.

As the chief enforcer of the Guardian Council, he walked alone, a darker shadow in the night.<br><br>The sky was dark with clouds, perfect for secret deeds. Simon wore black, even his fair hair covered by his tricorne hat. Not that he feared Lord Drayton, whose powers were less impressive than his ambitions, but a wise hunter left nothing to chance.<br><br>His horse had been left in a convenient field so that Simon could approach Castle Drayton unnoticed. He&#x2019;d studied the castle from a distance and spoken with a former servant, who had fled Drayton&#x2019;s service in fear of his soul. The master of the house was in residence, recently returned from London, where Drayton held a cabinet post. Simon had considered confronting him in the city before deciding that this remote area was better. If there was a magical battle, the fewer who might be affected, the better.<br><br>The castle stood on a rocky rise cradled in the bend of a small river that ran into the Severn. The original building had been updated and expanded over the centuries, but its site remained an imposing hill chosen to repel attacks. Soldiers would have a hard time penetrating the castle. Simon didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>He met the first barrier near the top of the hill. It was a warning shield of surprising competence. Drayton must have been practicing. Simon sketched a series of symbols with one hand. A man-sized hole opened in the energy shell. He stepped through and closed the portal behind him, undetected. Though he could have taken the wards down entirely, there was no reason to warn Drayton prematurely.<br><br>The next barrier was the closed gates. Luckily a small side door cut through the wall, its position largely concealed by overgrown vegetation. Its bespelled lock was no match for Simon. He hushed the squeal of the door and closed it soundlessly behind him. Best to leave it unlatched. He doubted he would have to leave in a rush, but he never took anything for granted. Enforcers of Guardian law who made assumptions were unlikely to die in bed.<br><br>In the shadow of the wall, he used his inner senses to study the courtyard. A pair of bored guards stood watch in the turret that loomed above the castle gates. In a peaceable England, that marked Drayton as a most suspicious man. The product of a guilty conscience, no doubt.<br><br>Before entering, Simon scanned the keep. At this hour most servants were asleep in the attics or the stables, a separate building behind the castle. He wrinkled his nose in distaste as he felt the energy of the establishment. It was crude, corrupted, with most of the residents either fearful or brutish. He felt the quicksilver touch of a lighter female energy, perhaps a very young maidservant. He guessed she would soon have reason to curse her parents for putting her into service under Drayton. Perhaps literally under. Still another reason to confront the man, before he could do more damage.<br><br>A corner chamber on the second floor was brightly lit, and he sensed that Drayton was working there. The man&#x2019;s energy was untroubled; he didn&#x2019;t realize his castle had been breached.<br><br>Cloaking himself in a don&#x2019;t-see spell, Simon crossed the courtyard and ascended the steps to the keep. There was no reaction from the guards in the turret. If they noticed him, it was only as a shadow.<br><br>The lock on the door to the keep was old and primitive, easy to open. He stepped into the absolute darkness of the entry hall. After pausing to check that the space was devoid of any living presence, Simon conjured a spark of mage light in his palm. He kept it dim, just enough to illuminate his path across the great hall and then up the broad stairs. His blood quickened as he ascended, knowing that the end of the hunt was nigh. Though he acted by will of the council to enforce the laws of the Families, the hunt itself fulfilled an ancient, more primitive need.<br><br>Cracks of light outlined the door to the corner chamber. The knob turned easily under his hand. As he had guessed, the room was a study, richly furnished and well lit. Lamplight glinted from gold-leaf decorations on the furniture and the frame of the mirror above the fireplace.<br><br>Simon wasted little attention on the furnishings. What mattered was Lord Drayton, the man behind the magnificent desk that faced the door. His powdered wig and brocade garments would not have been out of place at the royal palace.<br><br>Simon had found his prey.<br><br>Drayton raised his head at Simon&#x2019;s entrance. There was no shock in his expression. Only . . . a trace of satisfaction? Surely not.<br><br>&#x201c;If it isn&#x2019;t the esteemed Lord Falconer, dressed as a highwayman,&#x201d; Drayton said dryly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve wondered when you would come after me. I expected you sooner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I take my time when I collect my evidence.&#x201d; Simon&#x2019;s voice was cool, but a warning bell sounded in his mind. It wasn&#x2019;t natural for a mage to be so relaxed when confronted by the Guardian Council&#x2019;s enforcer. &#x201c;Not that it was difficult in your case. Lately you&#x2019;ve made little attempt to conceal your transgressions of Guardian law.&#x201d;<br><br>Drayton leaned back in his chair, playing idly with the quill of his pen. &#x201c;With what am I charged?&#x201d;<br><br>Simon pulled a folded document from an inside pocket and dropped it on the desk. &#x201c;Here is a listing of what I know and can prove, though I have no doubt there is much more. You have used your power with greed and selfishness, and injured many innocents in the process.&#x201d; He shook his head, still amazed at the other man&#x2019;s callousness. &#x201c;How could you encourage the Jacobite rising, knowing how many would die? Didn&#x2019;t those sundered souls cause you pain?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not particularly. Few of the dead were any great loss to mankind.&#x201d;<br><br>Simon clamped down on the anger triggered by the other man&#x2019;s words. Loss of control would put him at a disadvantage. &#x201c;I suggest you consult the charging documents. If there is anything you would like to dispute, now is the time.&#x201d;<br><br>Drayton skimmed the pages. &#x201c;Admirably thorough.&#x201d; His brows arched when he read the last page. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;d discover that. Well done. You&#x2019;re a credit to your lineage.&#x201d; He dropped the papers back on his desk. &#x201c;As you suspected, this is not a complete list of my wicked deeds, but it&#x2019;s quite enough for your purposes.&#x201d;<br><br>This interview was going all wrong. Drayton acted as if he was invulnerable, yet his magical power had never been more than average. Silently Simon began to scan the room, seeking dangerous anomalies. Aloud, he said, &#x201c;As you know, there are two stages of censure. You freely admit that you have violated Guardian laws. Are you prepared to swear on your blood that you will never do so again?&#x201d;<br><br>Drayton smiled lazily. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t imagine that I will do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And if you did, I can&#x2019;t imagine you keeping your word,&#x201d; Simon said dryly. &#x201c;You leave me no choice but to forcibly strip your powers from you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Strip away, Falconer.&#x201d; Drayton&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;If you can.&#x201d;<br><br>Simon hesitated a moment. The process of destroying another person&#x2019;s magical powers was not pleasant for either party, and was very seldom invoked. His intuition was also on high alert&#x2014;Drayton&#x2019;s reaction to this confrontation made no sense. Simon detected a very small thread of energy running from Drayton to an unknown destination, but nothing else was out of order. Why was the other man so confident?<br><br>Drayton stretched a magic-hazed hand toward a desk drawer. Seeing through the spell, Simon stared incredulously as the other man pulled out a pistol. Did Drayton really think such a crude defense would be enough to protect him from justice?<br><br>With a swift gesture to channel the energy, Simon destroyed the pistol&#x2019;s internal mechanism&#x2014;and in the same instant, he was blasted by a magic power unlike anything he had ever experienced. Every fiber of his being was under attack, ripping asunder.<br><br>As he gasped for breath, he realized that he was falling, unable to save himself, much less fight back. Drayton had pulled the pistol to distract Simon from the real attack. But where the bloody blue hell was the bastard getting such power? This was immense, far greater than anything the rogue had ever shown. Such power didn&#x2019;t come from nowhere.<br><br>He managed to evoke his inner senses and was startled to see that the fine thread of energy he&#x2019;d seen attached to Drayton had become a river of fire. Raw power poured into Drayton, who channeled it into searing waves that enveloped Simon. Agonized, he thrashed about on the floor, feeling as if he were burning alive. His limbs were being torn and reforged as in a blacksmith&#x2019;s fire. His pulse hammered in his ears, almost drowning the sound of Drayton&#x2019;s laughter and a strange, ripping noise.<br><br>He tried to muster his own power but he was overwhelmed, voiceless magically and physically. His mind was fracturing, clarity melting in Drayton&#x2019;s magical flames.<br><br>&#x201c;I have waited a long time to do this, Falconer,&#x201d; the other man hissed. &#x201c;In your arrogance, you thought you could take me. Instead, I am taking you.&#x201d;<br><br>More energy scorched through Simon, shocking as a lightning bolt. Was this death? But he had always thought death would be a quiet welcome, not this hell of agony and flames.<br><br>The last jolt of transforming power knocked him into blackness. Then, mercifully, the pain began to ebb away. Guessing that he had been unconscious only a moment, he struggled to regain his feet. But his body was unfamiliar, awkward.

In the late 1890s, Fr Allan McDonald, parish priest of the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides, made a collection of such stories which he entitled &#34;Strange Things&#34;. His book contains the only surviving body of material connected to an unfinished enquiry made on behalf of the Society of Psychical Research. The history of the enquiry and the reasons for its abandonment, is revealed here, as are many other facts about the Highland supernatural tradition, and also about the remarkable career of Society of Psychical research member Ada Goodrich Freer. Fascinating as a story of late Victorian obsessions, as a story of two different people and cultures, or simply as a story of one of the deepest strands of Hebridean culture, &#34;Strange Things&#34; is a story of tradition, folklore, manipulation, charlatanism and fraud, now reprinted for the first time since 1968.</p><p>John Lorne Campbell Was One Of The Gaelic World&#39;s Greatest Scholars And Has Made Hundreds Of Recordings Of Gaelic Songs And Stories.

PLATFORM 61</b><p></p><p>A BITTER COLD WEDNESDAY in February, nearly midnight. Jack strolled out of Grand Central Terminal and up Park Avenue to the Waldorf-Astoria, carrying his ancient suitcase. Seventeen hours on the 20th Century Limited, the most exclusive and luxurious train in America, and he felt as battered as if he&#x2019;d traveled by camel. He hadn&#x2019;t eaten much more than a Parker House roll. He hadn&#x2019;t slept, either. His skin was drawn tight across his cheekbones and his eyes had the feeling of August on the Cape&#x2014;too much sun and salt ripping across the Wianno&#x2019;s bow.</p><p>The hotel doorman was looking at him as though he were a Bowery bum in search of a heating grate. His clothes were a rumpled mess&#x2014;they always were; his mother was constantly nagging him about it&#x2014;but the Waldorf was Kennedy territory. His father had lived here for a year when Jack was a kid, and he still stayed at the hotel whenever he came to New York. His mother preferred the Plaza&#x2014;and booked it whether Dad was at the Waldorf or not. It was a metaphor for their marriage. Never mind separate beds; Joe and Rose got separate hotels.</p><p>&#x201c;Checking in, sir?&#x201d; the doorman inquired frigidly.</p><p>Jack handed him the suitcase. The man&#x2019;s arm sagged from the weight of his books.</p><p>&#x201c;I think my father already has a suite. Ambassador Kennedy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; The doorman snapped his ?ngers for a bellboy, his relief obvious. &#x201c;Welcome to the Waldorf-Astoria.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; He thought about tipping the guy, but before he could ?nd a quarter in his pants pocket, a hand came down on his shoulder. A surprisingly heavy hand. Like a cop&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Kennedy?&#x201d;</p><p>He turned around. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>There were three of them&#x2014;Foscarello, Casey, and Schwartz, as he would learn later. They wore trench coats and snap-brim fedoras, and although they bore no relation to one another, their faces had a blunt-featured sameness. Schwartz was in charge of this cutting-out expedition and it was he who&#x2019;d clapped his hand on Jack&#x2019;s shoulder. He was four inches shorter than Jack but his hips and chest had the centered mass of a wrestler.</p><p>Jack could feel the doorman watching him; he saw the bellboy halt in his tracks. And so he ?ashed his smile at the men who were not cops, and said, &#x201c;Gentlemen. What can I do for you?&#x201d;</p><p>THE MAN IN THE WHEELCHAIR couldn&#x2019;t sleep, but that was nothing new. Because his days were ?lled with too much talk and competing bids for attention, he&#x2019;d made a habit of insomnia; he thought more clearly in the emptiness of midnight. Four hours of peace were his as the train rolled north from Washington, and he&#x2019;d spent some of it reading the manila ? le that Ed Hoover had sent over from the Bureau that morning. When his eyes grew tired, he stared blankly at the protective steel louvers that striped his private Pullman&#x2019;s windows, thinking. He was pulled up in the lee of a desk bolted to the train car&#x2019;s ?oor. It was covered with cables from Europe.</p><p>He had owned this job for nearly eight years now, and the insomnia was building with the threat of war, a continuous adrenaline feed into his bloodstream. It was sapping his strength and his life, but he could no more give it up&#x2014;this excitement like a second pulse throbbing beneath his skin&#x2014;than he could choose to walk again. He knew, better than any man in America, just how critical the work was and how little time he might have to control it. The work was more vital than legs or sleep or even living a few years longer. It was de?ning the shape of the coming world&#x2014; <i>he</i> was de?ning the shape, he and a few other people on the opposite side of the ocean, and the crooks they tried to contain, and the sheer variability of facts and impulses that collided each day as randomly as a boy&#x2019;s marbles. He could not sleep because he could not stop watching the world as it gathered itself to explode.</p><p>A year ago&#x2014;1938&#x2014;Adolf Hitler had seized Austria, although the term he used was &#x201c;annexed,&#x201d; without ?ring a shot. A few months later, he&#x2019;d screamed for the German slice of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland, when what he really wanted was the country&#x2019;s munitions factories and uranium mines and a clear passage to the Russian border. Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, had ?own to Germany twice to tell Hitler he was welcome to the Czechs, if only he&#x2019;d leave England alone. Hitler had shaken on the deal and promised to be a good boy. The British public cheered with relief and called Chamberlain a savior.</p><p>The man in the wheelchair thought Chamberlain was an egotistical ass.</p><p>He squinted through his spectacles at the most recent cable&#x2014;it was from Poland, the next prize in Hitler&#x2019;s sights&#x2014;then set it down in favor of the manila ?le he&#x2019;d practically memorized.</p><p><i>Believed to be dying at age seventeen . . . misdiagnosed with leukemia . . . possible blood or liver disease . . . damaged vertebrae while playing football at Harvard . . . spends several weeks each year at the Mayo Clinic, with additional tests at Brigham Hospital . . . medical consensus: unlikely to thrive . . .</i></p><p>A slight sound from the doorway drew his head around; Missy was leaning there, the perfect personal aide, a cup of tea in her hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Like some?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; He took the cup from her, scenting the rum-spiked tea. As he drank, he tapped the manila ?le. &#x201c;Ever meet this boy?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Supposed to be a charmer.&#x201d; Roosevelt peered at her over his spectacles. &#x201c;The Black Sheep of the family. Hang around and say hello, if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>Missy had a soft spot for black sheep. She came over to his chair and planted a kiss on his head. &#x201c;My book&#x2019;s too good.&#x201d;</p><p>He eyed her critically. His wife would be reading an improving work ?lled with labor statistics. But Missy . . . &#x201c;Is it something by Jane Austen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dashiell Hammett. Tell me about Jack in the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>THEY LED HIM THROUGH a part of the Waldorf few guests ever saw and exited a service door into the hotel garage, pulling up eventually before a freight elevator. By this time Schwartz had ?ipped open his badge.</p><p>&#x201c;Secret Service,&#x201d; Jack mused. The Treasury department&#x2019;s special force. Which might mean he&#x2019;d been dragged out of the lobby because Dad had overplayed the markets again. Why not talk to his father, then? Why buttonhole Jack? It was important, he ?gured, to look unconcerned. To stay calm, even if his heart was racing. His eyes met Schwartz&#x2019;s and held them.</p><p>&#x201c;Is my father in some kind of trouble?&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t need to remind the Secret Service that Joe Kennedy had made a fortune manipulating stock in ways the Treasury department had never been able to prosecute. Franklin Roosevelt had made Jack&#x2019;s father his ?rst chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission as a reward for his cunning. <i>Set a thief to catch a thief</i>, Roosevelt had said&#x2014;or so Dad once told Jack, smiling his thin smile at the head of the dinner table. Dad found the President&#x2019;s cynicism funny. How could Treasury have caught up with Joe Kennedy <i>now</i>?</p><p>&#x201c;Last I heard,&#x201d; the man named Foscarello said, &#x201c;your old man was just swell. Out dancing with a hatcheck girl.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack ?ushed and almost went for Foscarello, but at that moment the doors of the freight elevator opened and Schwartz&#x2019;s hand was on his shoulder again, guiding him into the steel cage.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Kennedy,&#x201d; Schwartz said soothingly, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re President Roosevelt&#x2019;s bodyguards. He wants to see you. He&#x2019;s waiting below in his Pullman.&#x201d;</p><p>Foscarello stared at Jack without blinking and there was a de?nite challenge in the man&#x2019;s stolid face. The elevator lurched like a tin can on a string and Jack&#x2019;s stomach dropped sickly.</p><p>&#x201c;Below?&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;The President&#x2019;s Pullman is in the hotel&#x2019;s basement?&#x201d;</p><p>Schwartz sighed. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a track beneath us, Mr. Kennedy. The Waldorf was built over some old train yards connected to Grand Central. Platform 61 belongs to the hotel. Public trains don&#x2019;t stop here&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t actually ?nd the platform unless you know where to look. The President uses it on his way to Hyde Park.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack ran a hand tentatively over his hair. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure Mr. Roosevelt didn&#x2019;t ask for Joe Kennedy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He asked for Jack.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d he know I&#x2019;d be here tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>Schwartz almost smiled. &#x201c;I have no idea, Mr. Kennedy.&#x201d;</p><p>The elevator doors opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Jack said urgently. &#x201c;Anybody got a comb?&#x201d;</p><p>ROOSEVELT WAS PRETENDING to read the ?le when the boy slid through the doorway, ducking his head in deference to the occasion, one ?nger working at his tie. His clothes were a mess; so was his hair. It was remarkable hair: springy and barely tamed with pomade that&#x2019;d been applied a day and a half ago. Roosevelt dismissed Schwartz with a nod.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah. Jack. Good of you to come. Sit down, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. President.&#x201d;</p><p>It was all visitors ever said, as though the title implied whole layers of meaning&#x2014;<i>I&#x2019;m honored, I&#x2019;m bewildered, I&#x2019;m waiting to ?nd out what I did wrong</i>&#x2014;and for a moment Roosevelt was disappointed. He&#x2019;d expected more from the Black Sheep.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t exactly have a choice,&#x201d; Jack went on, with a sudden grin. &#x201c;Those boys of yours are very persuasive. But I like my nose unbroken. So I came along quietly.&#x201d;</p><p>There it was: The jauntiness. The inveterate curiosity. Roosevelt had guessed right about this one.</p><p>Jack sank into one of the Pullman&#x2019;s seats with unconscious grace.</p><p>His face was gaunt, his frame as thin as a teenager&#x2019;s. But Roosevelt caught a whi? of cordite on the air&#x2014;the scent of a ?red gun, a burnt match. It came from the kid in front him. Jack crackled with energy.</p><p>J. Edgar Hoover thought the boy was an embarrassment, the expendable Kennedy.</p><p>He&#x2019;s the kind who never ?nishes anything, the FBI chief had insisted as he&#x2019;d handed Roosevelt the ?le that morning. The kid who comes in second, the one who drops out, who trades on his daddy&#x2019;s name. He was nearly expelled from Choate, for God&#x2019;s sake, he was such a discipline problem. He quit the London School of Economics. And Princeton.</p><p>But Roosevelt never relied on a single source of information. He knew more about Jack than Hoover or his ?les would ever hold. Jack might be sick and his record might be checkered, but he was one of those rare souls completely at home in the world. It didn&#x2019;t matter that he was Irish or Catholic or that his father was regarded as an unprincipled cad; Jack slouched into the most breathless of WASP bastions in his careless clothes and threw his legs over armchairs like he&#x2019;d owned them from birth. His ease was admired and slavishly imitated; his quips and sarcasm circulated like a kissing disease. He was voted into Harvard&#x2019;s exclusive Spee Club when no Kennedy had ever made a ?nal club at Harvard before&#x2014;because his friends categorically refused to join without him.</p><p>Hoover loved to tick o? the ways Jack slid by: the standing account at the Hyannis Port gas station, where the convertible&#x2019;s tank was always ?lled and the owner never paid; the clothes strewn all over the ?oor of his college suite; the string of girls he picked up and dropped. But those things meant nothing to Franklin Roosevelt. He&#x2019;d been privileged and young once, too. He was much more interested in the ways Jack didn&#x2019;t conform to type. His love of risk. His analytic brain. His need to argue. His willingness to ditch the pack and go it alone.</p><p>His refusal to admit he probably wouldn&#x2019;t see thirty.</p><p>The man in the wheelchair looked at Jack Kennedy, and saw something he recognized. Something he&#x2019;d learned to respect. Something he was himself.</p><p>A survivor.</p><p>&#x201c;YOU&#x2019;RE WONDERING WHY you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; the President said.</p><p>The smile ?ashed again. &#x201c;I told Mr. Schwartz it was probably Dad you wanted to see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw your father in Washington. He&#x2019;s a ?ne man. I&#x2019;m proud of the job he&#x2019;s doing for us over there in London.&#x201d;</p><p>Roosevelt kept his voice light as he mouthed the lies; nobody ever won a boy&#x2019;s heart by insulting his father. He disliked Joe Kennedy more than most of the men who hung on his coattails; and he&#x2019;d never trusted him, even when Joe&#x2019;s money and Democratic contacts had helped win the &#x2019;32 election. Roosevelt had sent Joe to London mostly to get him out of his hair. He preferred to leave the Atlantic between them; if Roosevelt had his way, Joe would stay in England until after the 1940 election.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of you to say, sir.&#x201d; It was the correct response, of course&#x2014; but Roosevelt saw Jack&#x2019;s slight frown; he was wary, now. He&#x2019;d know, of course, that Roosevelt was forcing his father to return to London early&#x2014; two weeks before Jack sailed&#x2014;because he was fed up with Kennedy idling by his pool in Palm Beach, with his detective novels and his easy women and his fawning reporters drinking his whiskey, while they assessed Joe&#x2019;s chances of winning the presidency. Joe Kennedy <i>actually thought</i> he was Roosevelt&#x2019;s heir apparent. His ambition, Roosevelt thought, was childlike; for a crook he had very little guile. It was as though all his craftiness was reserved for making money. In the game of politics, Roosevelt could run circles around somebody like Joe. Even in a wheelchair.</p><p>He took a sip of Missy&#x2019;s tea. &#x201c;You know I was a Harvard man, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I put in a call today to Bruce Hopper. I believe you two are acquainted?&#x201d;</p><p>Jack sat up, on alert. &#x201c;Professor Hopper&#x2019;s my thesis adviser.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a ?ne man. Fought in the War, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard his Armistice Day lecture?&#x201d; the boy asked eagerly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ll never forget.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard it. Hopper tells me you&#x2019;re taking the spring semester o?, and sailing to Europe to research your senior thesis.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. I leave in two weeks. Dad was supposed to travel with me, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I ordered him back to London.&#x201d; Roosevelt bared his teeth in a smile. &#x201c;Hopper says you mean to tour Germany this spring. Aren&#x2019;t you afraid of heading into a war zone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Begging your pardon, sir&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s not my war.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Again, a slight frown creased Jack&#x2019;s forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad says the American public will never accept another European war. The polls look pretty solid on that point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You care about polls?&#x201d; Roosevelt asked genially.</p><p>Jack shrugged. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re a moment frozen in time. One piece of information. And opinions change, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;According to circumstances. If we were attacked, for instance. And had no choice but to go to war.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.

Tour.</p><p>Padgett Powell is the author of six novels, including <i>The Interrogative Mood</i> and <i>You &amp; Me. </i>His novel <i>Edisto</i> was a finalist for the National Book Award. His writing has appeared in the<i> New Yorker</i>,<i> Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i>,<i> Little Star</i>, and the <i>Paris Review</i>, and he is the recipient of the Rome Fellowship in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, as well as the Whiting Writers&#x2019; Award. He lives in Gainesville, Florida, where he teaches writing at MFA@FLA, the writing program of the University of Florida.&nbsp;Powell returns to the coastal South Carolina town that was the setting for his first novel, Edisto (1984), and though it's years later, his ``lost souls'' haven't exactly found themselves. Thank goodness for that, for nobody needs platitudes when we have Powell's inimitably goofy sententiousness--a compendium of boozy wit and dyspeptic wisdom. Simons Manigault, the precocious narrator of Edisto, has grown up, sort of. After managing to secure a degree in architecture, he's now retreated back home. His country club Daddy, meanwhile, expects him to fulfill his destiny with a fancy Atlanta firm. Simons's mom languishes by the shore, gin and tonic still in hand. Visiting her is Simons's sexy older cousin Patricia. Simons and she become lovers, creating ``a match made in helplessness,'' with no small amount of taboo tossed in. Simons's first cousin has had a series of relationships with men that, he learns, always end in psychotic behavior and lesbian dabblings, matters sufficiently alarming to convince him to hit the road. After a desultory period spent fish brokering in Texas, Simons catches up with his mother's old lover, Taurus, now a game warden in Louisiana, who shows him what ``lies at the absolute end of the road of dalliance.'' A night with two obese nurses also demonstrates ``the nadir of sexual opportunity,'' and Simons heads home to become a ``visionless architect shacked up with his cousin,'' settling into a career in which he blithely dupes his clients with artsy lingo. Simons has always been AWOL (``absent with opprobrious love''), though now he's transferred that love from his mother to Patricia. All of which proves his point that ``you get in grooves in life, and you by God stay in them until the record plays out.'' Powell cleverly mocks the burdens of southern history (``The Wawer, The Wawer!''), and plays Simons as the most outlandish southern poseur, but it's his awesome command of language that finally makes him a writer to reckon with. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

King, creator of San Francisco homicide detective Kate Martinelli, has been praised by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> for her "taut pacing...air of menace...superb characters." Now the author of <b>A Grave Talent</b> (winner of the top mystery awards on both sides of the Atlantic), <b>To Play the Fool</b>, and <b>With Child</b> continues the series with a crime novel as disturbing as it is riveting.<br><br>After her last harrowing case Kate is more than ready for routine police work and a newfound serenity with her longtime lover, Lee, and their circle of close friends. Until one night when her pager summons her to a scene of carefully executed murder. Half-hidden in a clump of bushes lies a well-muscled corpse, handcuffed and strangled, a stun gun's faint burn on his chest and candy in his pocket. The only person who might have wanted airport baggage handler James Larsen dead, it seems, is the wife he repeatedly abused--who recently left him for a women's shelter. But her alibi is airtight, her physique frail, and her attitude less than vengeful.<br><br>Kate and her partner, Al Hawkin, are stumped. Then a second body turns up--also zapped, cuffed, strangled...and carrying a chocolate bar. It is that of Matthew Banderas, a software salesman convicted of one rape, suspected of many more.<br><br>Yet, despite the newspaper headlines, Kate and Al can establish no personal link between the victims and cannot rule out coincidence. But in the midst of an unpromising investigation, Kate has another cause thrust upon her by her friend, feminist minister Roz Hall. Investigators have already called it an accident, but Roz is convinced the young Indian bride was actually murdered--and when Roz takes up a crusade, no one can deny her. As Kate wrestles with the clash between her personal and professional lives, a third killing draws her and Al into a network of pitiless destruction that reaches far beyond San Francisco, a contemporary-style hit list with shudderingly primal roots.<br><br>Winner of the Best First Crime Novel Award from both the Mystery Writers of America and the British Crime Writers' Association for the first book in the Kate Martinelli series, <b>A Grave Talent</b>, Laurie R.

King creates novels that have the intensity and depth of superb literary work, spiced with harrowing suspense. --&gt;</p><p>Laurie King's first Kate Martinelli mystery, <i>A Grave Talent</i>, won Best First Novel honors from both the Mystery Writers of America and the British Crime Writers' Association. In this fourth installment in the series, King once again displays her talent as both a prose stylist and a masterful plotter in a case that proves to be personally harrowing for her heroine. <p> While attending a school play one evening, Detective Martinelli gets what appears to be a routine page about a homicide. The murder victim is James Larsen, an airport baggage handler found in the Presidio, handcuffed, strangled, and with stun-gun burns on his chest. And apparently he had a sweet tooth, given the candies found in his pocket. When it comes out that Larsen was an abusive husband whose wife now lives in a shelter, Martinelli's list of suspects takes a distasteful turn. Could the perpetrator be connected with the Ladies of Perpetual Disgruntlement, the group of secretive women (or men) who've lately been terrorizing abusers and rapists around the city with their humorous, updated version of the tar-and-feather treatment? Could it be Larsen's wife, a mousy woman who, nonetheless, is clearly harboring some secrets? Could it be Roz Hall, Martinelli's social crusading feminist minister friend? In each case, rage would be justified, but not murder. </p><p> When two additional murder victims with similar profiles--and pockets full of candy--surface, the San Francisco media takes an interest in this latest instance of vigilante justice. The investigation is further complicated by Roz's very public interest in the case of a young Indian bride who she believes was murdered. As Martinelli and her partner Al Hawkins try to sort through the mire of emotional entanglements, personal politics, and public scrutiny, King deftly maneuvers her tale through several carefully crafted turns. The novel is also threaded with Hindu spirituality and images of the dark goddess Kali, a vengeful figure perfectly appropriate in a novel about victimized women striking back. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Kate and her partner, Al Hawkin, are called to a scene of carefully executed murder: the victim is a muscular man, handcuffed and strangled, a stun gun&#39;s faint burn on his chest and candy in his pocket. The likeliest person to want him dead, his often-abused wife, is meek and frail -- and has an airtight alibi. Kate and Al are stumped, until a second body turns up -- also zapped, cuffed, and strangled...and carrying a candy bar. This victim: a convicted rapist. As newspaper headlines speculate about vendetta killings, a third death draws Kate and Al into a network of pitiless destruction that reaches far beyond San Francisco, a modern-style hit list with shudderingly primal roots.</p><h2>Nothing Like It In The World: The Men Who Built the Trancontinental Railroad, 1863-1869</h2><p>This is the story of the brave men who built the transcontinental railroad - the famous and the unheralded, ordinary men doing the extraordinary - who accomplished the spectacular feat that made the continent into a nation.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln, who had worked as a riverboat pilot before turning to politics, knew a thing or two about the problems of transporting goods and people from place to place. He was also convinced that the United States would flourish only if its far-flung regions were linked, replacing sectional loyalties with an overarching sense of national destiny.<p> Building a transcontinental railroad, writes the prolific historian Stephen Ambrose, was second only to the abolition of slavery on Lincoln's presidential agenda. Through an ambitious program of land grants and low-interest government loans, he encouraged entrepreneurs such as California's "Big Four"--Charles Crocker, Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins, and Leland Stanford--to take on the task of stringing steel rails from ocean to ocean. The real work of doing so, of course, was on the shoulders of immigrant men and women, mostly Chinese and Irish. These often-overlooked actors and what a contemporary called their "dreadful vitality" figure prominently in Ambrose's narrative, alongside the great financiers and surveyors who populate the standard textbooks.</p><p> In the end, Ambrose writes, Lincoln's dream transformed the nation, marking "the first great triumph over time and space" and inaugurating what has come to be known as the American Century. David Haward Bain's <i>Empire Express</i>, which covers the same ground, is more substantial, but Ambrose provides an eminently readable study of a complex episode in American history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Stephen E.

Tina Fey is not that woman, but she met that woman once and acted weird around her. Before 30 Rock, Mean Girls and &#39;Sarah Palin&#39;, Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV. She has seen both these dreams come true. At last, Tina Fey&#39;s story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence. Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we&#39;ve all suspected: you&#39;re no one until someone calls you bossy.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2011</strong>: Tina Fey&#x2019;s new book <em>Bossypants</em> is short, messy, and impossibly funny (an apt description of the comedian herself). From her humble roots growing up in Pennsylvania to her days doing amateur improv in Chicago to her early sketches on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, Fey gives us a fascinating glimpse behind the curtain of modern comedy with equal doses of wit, candor, and self-deprecation. Some of the funniest chapters feature the differences between male and female comedy writers ("men urinate in cups"), her cruise ship honeymoon ("it&#x2019;s very <em>Poseidon Adventure</em>"), and advice about breastfeeding ("I had an obligation to my child to pretend to try"). But the chaos of Fey&#x2019;s life is best detailed when she&#x2019;s dividing her efforts equally between rehearsing her Sarah Palin impression, trying to get Oprah to appear on <em>30 Rock</em>, and planning her daughter&#x2019;s Peter Pan-themed birthday. <em>Bossypants</em> gets to the heart of why Tina Fey remains universally adored: she embodies the hectic, too-many-things-to-juggle lifestyle we all have, but instead of complaining about it, she can just laugh it off. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em></p>Tina Fey was the first female head writer of Saturday Night Live and created, writes and stars in 30 Rock. She has received numerous awards for her comedy writing, including the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, 5 Emmys, and 5 Writers Guild Awards. She also wrote and appeared in the acclaimed and wildly popular movie Mean Girls.</p><h2>A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-tested Strategy for Successful Investing</h2><p>Updated with a new chapter that draws on behavioral finance, the field that studies the psychology of investment decisions, here is the best-selling, authoritative, and gimmick-free guide to investing.

She lives in an historic farmhouse in western Maryland.</p>Laurel Lefkow's characterization amplifies the dated gender stereotypes of this mystery surrounding a Civil War-era house. The female characters (a mother and the girl her son is infatuated with) speak in voices as lightweight as one would expect in women who are deferential to all males. The son and the father of the girl exude machismo as they vie for the women's affections and seek to outmaneuver one another in finding the reason for the disturbances in the house. The narrative voice is a bit annoying in its movement between full-voice and a half-whisper. However, as the book progresses, the volume ranges become less pronounced, and it becomes easier to find a comfortable and effective listening volume.

He is also the author of Death March: The Survivors of Bataan and The Korean War: Uncertain Victory (with Alfred Coppel).America's "forgotten veterans of the invisible war" are well represented in this collection of extended reminiscences by participants in the first seven months of the Korean War. The majority of the voices here are those of infantrymen recounting their experiences during that fluid and bitterly fought phase of the struggle. Campaigns covered include the Pusan Perimeter, the Inchon landing, the liberation of Seoul, the drive to the Yalu and the long retreat following Chinese entry into the war. Although it was clearly necessary to edit the statements collected in the course of research, Knox (Death March, etc.) has compressed away much of the individuality: almost everyone seems to have the same speech pattern. After the first 300 pages, only Korean War veterans are likely to remain engrossed, especially since many of the actions described are similar. The recollections are interrupted occasionally by brief summaries of strategic and tactical developments that set them in context. Photos. BOMC and History Book Club alternates.

This work carries a personal selection of twenty-six houses that reflect the development of style in Scotland, from old tower houses such as Cawdor through Baroque masterpieces like Drumlanrig and the pioneering Classicism of Kinross right up to the Edwardian opulence of Manderston and Ardkinglas.</p><p>Hard to Find bookLively and sumptuous -- <i>The Spectator</i></p><h2>Desperation</h2><p>Arrested by a policeman in Nevada with supernatural powers and jailed in a tow called Desperation, travelers are ?saved? by a child prisoner.</p><p>A notice to those who feel that Stephen King has lost his magic touch: <i>Desperation</i> is the genuine goods. The ensemble cast of ordinary Americans thrown together by chance, including a disgruntled alcoholic writer and a child who is wise beyond his years, may be a bit too familiar. But the nearly deserted Nevada mining town with an enormous haunted mine pit and an abandoned movie theatre where the survivors hang out makes for a striking battleground, and the grisly action rarely flags. Best of all, though, are the characters of Tak, the ancient body-hopping evil who emerges from the mine, and of "God"--whom the <i>New York Times</i> describes as "the edgiest creation in <i>Desperation.</i> Remote, isolated, ironic, shrouded behind disguises, perhaps 'another legendary shadow,' this deity forms a sly foil, and an icy mirror, to Tak."Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono. He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, and their children in Bangor, Maine.</p><h2>Alan Turing: The Enigma: The Centenary Edition</h2><p>It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the British mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) saved the Allies from the Nazis, invented the computer and artificial intelligence, and anticipated gay liberation by decades--all before his suicide at age forty-one. This classic biography of the founder of computer science, reissued on the centenary of his birth with a substantial new preface by the author, is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life. A gripping story of mathematics, computers, cryptography, and homosexual persecution, Andrew Hodges&#39;s acclaimed book captures both the inner and outer drama of Turing&#39;s life. Hodges tells how Turing&#39;s revolutionary idea of 1936--the concept of a universal machine--laid the foundation for the modern computer and how Turing brought the idea to practical realization in 1945 with his electronic design. The book also tells how this work was directly related to Turing&#39;s leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers du</p><p>Alan Turing died in 1954, but the themes of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges:<p> </p><blockquote>Alan had proved that there was no "miraculous machine" that could solve all mathematical problems, but in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea of a universal machine that could take over the work of <i>any</i> machine.</blockquote><p> During World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German's Enigma machine code was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security, implemented with machines and remorseless logic: "It was his own invention, and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs."</p><p> Andrew Hodges's remarkable insight weaves Turing's mathematical and computer work with his personal life to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek Jacobi movie <i>Breaking the Code</i>. Hodges has the mathematical knowledge to explain the intellectual significance of Turing's work, while never losing sight of the human and social picture: </p><p> </p><blockquote>In this sense his life belied his work, for it could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society, the individual and history.</blockquote><p> And Hodges admits what all biographers know, but few admit, about their subjects: "his inner code remains unbroken." Alan Turing is still an enigma. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><p>"One of the finest scientific biographies I've ever read: authoritative, superbly researched, deeply sympathetic, and beautifully told."<b>--Sylvia Nasar, author of<i>A Beautiful Mind</i></b></p><p>"A captivating, compassionate portrait of a first-rate scientist who gave so much to a world that in the end cruelly rejected him.

Her last book, L&#39;Art Contemporain, was published in 1997. She curated the French section of the 1989 Sao Paulo Biennale and the French Pavilion at the 1995 Venice Biennale.Millet, art critic and editor of Art Press, has become a literary sensation in France with the publication of this graphic memoir of some 30 years of her sexual adventures. Millet's "gift for observation" and her "solid superego" are as useful in her career as an art critic as they are in her erotic explorations: her ability to concentrate and observe puts her inside "other people's skins." Comparisons have been made to The Story Of O, but Millet is more in the tradition of Jean Genet and Violette Leduc, whose descriptions of their sexual encounters were not meant to titillate so much as to explore the meaning of the erotic. Millet's "quest for the sexual grail" takes her to group orgies, gang bangs in French parks and other serial sex escapades. Before long, the sex begins to seem utterly routine, in spite of the elaborate staging. Millet and her readers are then free to consider more closely some questions she raises: how oral sex compares to vaginal intercourse; why sex in disgusting circumstances is not about "self-abasement," but raising oneself "above all prejudice"; or why solitary sex is more pleasurable for her than sex with a partner. Toward the end of this curiously graceful memoir, Millet comes close to explaining her need for all this sex: only by sloughing off the "mechanical body" she'd been born with could she experience actual sexual pleasure. While women readers will find much of interest, male readers may have to overcome a certain emperor's new clothes-type discomfort, as they realize that Millet may know more about the male body than they do. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World</h2><p>Life sometimes seems illogical. Individuals do strange things: take drugs, have unprotected sex, mug each other. Love seems irrational, and so does divorce. On a larger scale, life seems no fairer or easier to fathom: Why do some neighborhoods thrive and others become ghettos? Why is racism so persistent? Why is your idiot boss paid a fortune for sitting behind a mahogany altar? Thorny questions&#x2013;and you might be surprised to hear the answers coming from an economist. <br><br>But Tim Harford, award-winning journalist and author of the bestseller T<i>he Undercover Economist</i>, likes to spring surprises. In this deftly reasoned book, Harford argues that life is logical after all. Under the surface of everyday insanity, hidden incentives are at work, and Harford shows these incentives emerging in the most unlikely places. <br><br>Using tools ranging from animal experiments to supercomputer simulations, an ambitious new breed of economist is trying to unlock the secrets of society. <i>The Logic of Life</i><b> </b>is the first book to map out the astonishing insights and frustrating blind spots of this new economics in a way that anyone can enjoy. <br><br><i>The Logic of Life</i><b> </b>presents an X-ray image of human life, stripping away the surface to show us a picture that is revealing, enthralling, and sometimes disturbing. The stories that emerge are not about data or equations but about people: the athlete who survived a shocking murder attempt, the computer geek who beat the hard-bitten poker pros, the economist who defied Henry Kissinger and faked an invasion of Berlin, the king who tried to buy off a revolution.<br>Once you&#x2019;ve read this quotable and addictive book, life will never look the same again.<b><br></b></p><p><b>A Message to Amazon Readers from Author Tim Harford</b> <p></p> Give yourself a pat on the back. You're not as stupid as everyone says you are, and now there's a book that proves it. <p></p> When I first conceived of <i>The Logic of Life</i>, my aim was to show that a world full of smart people--people like you, that is--doesn&#x2019;t necessarily look logical on the surface. We eat too much and worry about being fat; drink too much and cringe when we remember; spend too much at Christmas and worry about the bills in New Year. And that&#x2019;s just the small stuff: what about crime, racial segregation, divorce, big-money politics? <p></p> And yet underneath it all there is a hidden logic. It isn&#x2019;t always pretty, but it&#x2019;s there if you know how to see it. That is what <i>The Logic of Life</i> is all about. <p></p> But when I'd finished the first draft, my editor told me that he didn't think that people were as logical as I'd said. He wanted me to prove my point. <p></p> At first, I thought it was my editor thinks people are illogical because he works in the publishing business. Of course life looks illogical if you do that. (In fact, life looks crazy in most offices: see "Why Your Boss is Overpaid," chapter four.) But then I realised he was right. I'd left the most important step out. <p></p> So I went back and made sure that I laid out all the amazing evidence. I looked at single women hitting the dating scene in American cities; I looked at juvenile delinquents across the US; I looked at Mexican prostitutes; I looked at traders at a convention in Disney World; I looked at professional poker players in Las Vegas and professional soccer players in Europe. I looked at violent spouses, alcoholics, and school bullies. <p></p> In every case I discovered a story of hidden incentives and unexpected logic. And through the process of writing--and living--the book, I discovered that this crazy world of ours makes more sense than you might think. <br><br>Tim Harford is the author of the bestseller <i>The Undercover Economist</i> and <i>The Logic of Life</i> and a member of the editorial board of the <i>Financial Times,</i> where he also writes the &#x201c;Dear Economist&#x201d; column.

This timely resource discusses the relationship between historical criticism and Christian theology to encourage evangelical engagement with historical-critical scholarship. Charting a middle course between wholesale rejection and unreflective embrace, the book introduces evangelicals to a way of understanding and using historical-critical scholarship that doesn&#39;t compromise Christian orthodoxy. The book covers eight of the most hotly contested areas of debate in biblical studies, helping readers work out how to square historical criticism with their beliefs.</p><p>"This carefully argued book urges evangelical Christians to reexamine the potential of historical-critical biblical criticism. The authors seek not universal acceptance of what they propose so much as fresh evangelical engagement with questions involving the methods of biblical criticism--and therefore with Scripture itself. In this aim they succeed admirably."<br>--<b>Mark A. Noll</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"Hays and Ansberry provide evangelical students with something they rarely see: a discussion of the major critical issues in biblical studies combined with a respectful, discerning appreciation for the biblical text as <i>scripture</i>. Too often students must choose between academic rigor and personal belief. A well-written volume treating these issues is a rare gift to a new generation of students now looking at many of these issues for the very first time."<br>--<b>Gary M. Burge</b>, Wheaton College<br> <br>"A learned and pastoral collection of essays calling for evangelicals to engage with and integrate into their faith the genuine insights of historical criticism. The contributors exhibit the courage to give both faith and historical criticism the respect they deserve. This volume is a welcome addition to the growing number of evangelical voices calling for a reassessment of an evangelical doctrine of Scripture, not as an attack but for the end goal of supporting and enriching the evangelical movement."<br>--<b>Peter Enns</b>, Eastern University<br><br>"Chris Hays and Chris Ansberry engage in the courageous task of showing how evangelical scholars can soberly address the hot-potato issues in biblical scholarship, even appropriate many critical insights, without selling out on what evangelicals traditionally believe. This is the type of discussion on faith and criticism that evangelical scholarship has needed for years."<br>--<b>Michael Bird</b>, Ridley Melbourne College of Mission and Ministry, Australia<br><br>"A project like this is long overdue. Our students need to read essays and books that will not only orient them to the goals and methods of critical biblical scholarship but also provide them with a sieve with which to sift what they are reading. While a book of this sort could deal with two dozen or more critical subjects, the editors have chosen eight that scream the most loudly for attention.

Is it all just a matter of generation and taste? Are the traditions of today only the innovations of yesterday? This lively and clearly reasoned book focuses on four crucial principles of worship laid down by Christ and strongly re-affirmed at the Reformation. These central pillars are rapidly passing out of sight today, yet it is surely by these that all new ideas should be assessed. Here also is a fascinating view of how they worshipped in Bible times, including the Old Testament rules for the use of instruments, and New Testament light on all the elements of worship normative for today. Worship in the Melting Pot has instantly become core reading among British evangelical pastors and lay people. Searching and challenging; dealing with principles not personalities</p><p>Dr Peter Masters has been Minister of the world-famous Metropolitan Tabernacle (Spurgeon's) in central London since 1970. He edits the international magazine 'Sword &amp; Trowel' (started by Spurgeon in 1865) and directs the studies of aspiring pastors in the Tabernacle's adjunct seminary.Chapter 1: Worship in the Melting Pot <p>Worship is truly in the melting pot. A new style of praise has swept into evangelical life, shaking to the foundations traditional concepts and attitudes. The style of worship followed throughout the entire history of Bible-believing churches has been shunted on to the sidelines &#x2013; and why not? Young friends are asking &#x2013; &#x2018;What&#x2019;s the matter with contemporary music groups? Isn&#x2019;t there every kind of instrument, including percussion, in the Psalms? Didn&#x2019;t they dance in worship in Bible times? Isn&#x2019;t God the same yesterday, today and for ever? Why should we be tied to gloomy Victorian culture in our praise to God?&#x2019; </p><p>The aim of this book is to answer such questions, and also to focus on the four great pillars of worship &#x2013; the principles which the Bible insists on. Are these in our minds when we think through our style of worship? </p><p>Many Christians today are amazed when you show them what really happened in the Old Testament, and then they feel cheated over the superficial ideas they have been sold. They become deeply thoughtful on hearing the definitions of worship given by the Saviour, and on seeing all the practical instructions of the epistles. </p><p>Our approach to worship is undoubtedly the most important issue confronting Bible churches today, and here is why. Six new, highly flawed styles of worship may be observed &#x2013; often all mixed together. There is personal-pleasure worship, which puts the worshipper&#x2019;s enjoyment in first place, rather than God&#x2019;s desire. There is worldly-idiom worship, which borrows the current entertainment music of the world with its rhythms, instruments, actions and showbiz presentation, heedless of all the Bible&#x2019;s warnings about loving the world. There is aesthetic worship, which imagines that orchestras, bands and instrumental solos are real expressions of worship, as if God is worshipped through these things, whereas Christ said &#x2013; &#x2018;God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.&#x2019; There is ecstatic worship, in which people work themselves into highly emotional and even semi-hypnotic states, whereas Scripture says that we must always pray and sing with the understanding. There is shallow worship, which reduces hymns to choruses conveying one or two elementary ideas, because solid spiritual themes are not wanted. There is informal worship, in which casual, jokey, trivia-injecting leaders turn churches into sitting rooms, so depriving the Lord of dignity, reverence, grandeur and glory. </p><p>It is as though evangelical churches have caught six viruses at the same time. How can churches survive if their highest occupation is sick? How can God&#x2019;s people keep themselves unspotted from the world, if the world has taken over the worship? How can we call lost souls out of the world, if we are the same as the world? Worship is certainly the most important topic of the hour. </p><p>In this book I would like to speak with great respect to fellow pastors and church officers who may be inclined to adopt some elements of new worship. There are numerous dedicated Gospel workers who have come to feel that they should give guarded partial acceptance to this trend. They may not care for it personally, but they have been persuaded that their reservations are merely a matter of taste and culture. To get people into youth meetings and churches (says today&#x2019;s wisdom) we must employ contemporary worship songs. </p><p>Another suggestion is that we should introduce some of the new alongside the old, thus preserving the best of traditional worship. The problem with this proposal is that the old and the new represent opposing concepts of worship, as these pages will show. The new breaches all the biblical principles recovered at the Reformation. Even the history of new worship rings alarm bells, and demonstrates the chasm between the old and the new. </p><p>The development of new worship is now fairly well known, and can be sketched here in a few sentences. It mainly began in California in the late 1960s, when many hippies turned to Christ, becoming known as the &#x2018;Jesus people&#x2019;. They worshipped with the very same style of song which they had known as hippies. Various Christian movements were formed to encourage them, among them the well-known Calvary Chapels. Their worship consisted mostly of one-verse choruses, endlessly repeated. The words were simple &#x2013; much simpler even than those of a traditional children&#x2019;s chorus &#x2013; and the themes also were elementary. There was seldom any confession of sin or any doctrine. However well-intended it may have been, the new worship was not shaped or influenced by any biblical model of worship, nor by the general practice of Bible-believing churches up to that time. </p><p>It was a form of worship fashioned and conceived in the womb of meditational mysticism, in which hippies in their hundreds and thousands would sit on Californian hillsides with eyes closed, swaying themselves into an ecstatic state, echoing their previous experience with drugs. Former hippies carried into their new Christian allegiance the same quest for emotional sensation to which they were accustomed, and, sadly, none of their Christian mentors showed them a better way. </p><p>This new approach to worship rapidly advanced, merging with another new stream of &#x2018;Christian&#x2019; songs written by those who simply wanted worship music to be like secular rock music. In other words, the latter wanted a &#x2018;good time&#x2019; in a worldly sense. We need to be aware that new worship sprang from these two stables, namely, hippie mysticism, and worldly Christianity. It was immediately incorporated into the charismatic movement, from which the vast majority of new worship songs have come. Such background information should lead us to great caution, but the biblical principles of the following pages should be the decisive factor in whether we accept or reject the new ways. We certainly cannot blend opposing concepts.</p></p><h2>The Last Surgeon</h2><p>The New York Times bestselling author and master of medical suspense delivers another shocker of a thriller filled with insider details and a terrifying psychopath Four murders.

So he&#x2019;s alive, after all. And right here, by your bedside. Relief floods through you.<br><br>Then his face appears, looking down at you. He&#x2019;s wearing what he always wears: black jeans, a plain gray T-shirt, and a white baseball cap. But his face is gaunt, the lines deeper than you&#x2019;ve ever seen them before.<br><br>&#x201c;Abbie,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Abbie.&#x201d; His eyes glisten with tears, which fills you with alarm. Tim never cries.<br><br>&#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; Your voice is hoarse.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was there an accident? Is Danny okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Danny&#x2019;s fine. Rest now. I&#x2019;ll explain later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have I had surgery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Later. I promise. When you&#x2019;re stronger.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m stronger now.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s true: Already the pain is receding, the fog and grogginess clearing from your head.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s incredible,&#x201d; he says, not to you but the nurse. &#x201c;Amazing. It&#x2019;s her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was dreaming,&#x201d; you say. &#x201c;About when you proposed. It was so vivid.&#x201d; That&#x2019;ll be the anesthetic, you realize. It makes things richer. Like that line from that play. What was it? For a moment the words elude you but then, with an almost painful effort, a clunk, you remember.<br><br>I cried to dream again.<br><br>Again Tim&#x2019;s eyes fill with tears.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be sad,&#x201d; you tell him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m alive. That&#x2019;s all that matters, isn&#x2019;t it? We&#x2019;re all three of us alive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sad,&#x201d; he says, smiling through his tears. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy. People cry when they&#x2019;re happy, too.&#x201d;<br><br>You knew that, of course. But even through the pain and the drugs you can tell those aren&#x2019;t everything&#x2019;s-going-to-be-all-right-now tears. Have you lost your legs? You try to move your feet and feel them&#x2014;slowly, stiffly&#x2014;responding under the blanket. Thank God.<br><br>Tim seems to come to a decision.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something I have to explain, my love,&#x201d; he says, taking your hand in his. &#x201c;Something very difficult, but you need to know right away. That wasn&#x2019;t a dream. It was an upload.&#x201d;<br><br>2<br><br>Your first thought is that you&#x2019;re hallucinating&#x2014;that this, not the dream about him proposing, is the bit that isn&#x2019;t real. How can it be? What he&#x2019;s saying to you now&#x2014;a stream of technical stuff about mind files and neural nets&#x2014;simply makes no sense.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. Are you saying something happened to my brain?&#x201d;<br><br>Tim shakes his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying you&#x2019;re artificial. Intelligent, conscious . . . but man-made.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; you insist, baffled. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ll tell you three random things about myself. My favorite meal is salade Ni�oise. I was angry for weeks last year because my favorite cashmere jacket got eaten by moths. I go swimming almost every day&#x2014;&#x201d; You stop. Your voice, instead of reflecting your rising panic, is coming out in a dull, croaky monotone. A Stephen Hawking voice.<br><br>&#x201c;The damage to that jacket was six years ago,&#x201d; Tim says. &#x201c;I kept it, though. I&#x2019;ve kept all your things.&#x201d;<br><br>You stare at him, trying to get your head around this.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m not doing this very well.&#x201d; He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket. &#x201c;Here&#x2014;I wrote this for our investors. Maybe it&#x2019;ll help.&#x201d;<br><br>FAQ<br><br>Q: What is a cobot?<br><br>A: Cobot is short for &#x201c;companion robot.&#x201d; Studies with prototypes suggest the presence of a cobot may alleviate the loss of a loved one, providing solace, company, and emotional support in the aftermath of bereavement.<br><br>Q: How will cobots differ from other forms of artificial intelligence?<br><br>A: Cobots have been specifically designed to be empathetic.<br><br>Q: Will each cobot be unique?<br><br>A: Each cobot will be customized to closely replicate the physical appearance of the loved one. Social media rec�ords, texts, and other documents will be aggregated to create a &#x201c;neural file&#x201d; reflecting their unique traits and personality.<br><br>There&#x2019;s more, much more, but you can&#x2019;t focus. You let the sheet fall from your hand. Only Tim could possibly imagine that a list of factual questions and answers could help at a time like this.<br><br>&#x201c;This is what you do,&#x201d; you remember. &#x201c;You design artificial intelligence. But that&#x2019;s something to do with customer service&#x2014;chatbots&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he interrupts. &#x201c;I was working on that side of it. But that was five years ago&#x2014;your memories are all five years out of date. After I lost you, I realized bereavement was the bigger need. It&#x2019;s taken all this time to get you to this stage.&#x201d;<br><br>His words take a moment to sink in. Bereavement. You&#x2019;ve just realized what he&#x2019;s trying to tell you.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying I died.&#x201d; You stare up at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying the real me died&#x2014;what? Five years ago. And you&#x2019;ve somehow brought me back like this.&#x201d;<br><br>He doesn&#x2019;t reply.<br><br>You feel a mixture of emotions. Disbelief, obviously. But also horror at the thought of his grief, at what he must have been through. At least you were spared that.<br><br>Cobots have been specifically designed to be empathetic . . . <br><br>And Danny. You&#x2019;ve missed five whole years of his life.<br><br>At the thought of Danny, a familiar sadness washes over you. A sadness you firmly put to one side. And that, too&#x2014;both the sadness, and the putting-aside&#x2014;feels so normal, so ordinary, that it can&#x2019;t be anything except your own, individual emotion.<br><br>Can it?</p><h2>Bound to Violence</h2><p>Published in France in 1968 &amp; winner of the Prix Renaudot.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Country architecture: Old-fashioned designs for gazebos, summerhouses, springhouses, smokehouses, stables, greenhouses, carriage houses, outhouses, ... doghouses, sheds, and other outbuildings</h2><p>Country architecture: Old-fashioned designs for gazebos, summerhouses, springhouses, smokehouses, stables, greenhouses, carriage houses, outhouses, ... doghouses, sheds, and other outbuildings</p><p></p><h2>Promise and Deliverance: From Creation to the Conquest of Canaan v. 1</h2><p>Promise and Deliverance by De Graaf is a helpful resource.</p><p></p><h2>The &#39;Ulama of Farangi Mahall and Islamic Culture in South Asia</h2><p>The learned and holy men of farangi mahall were the consolidators in india of the rationalist traditions of islamic scholarship derived from iran these were encapsulated in a renowned and widely used syllabus which they created and which became the dominant system of indian islamic education from the eighteenth century these traditions represented a confident and flexible islamic understanding which, many felt, had the capacity to preserve islam even while selectively adopting social, cultural and technological changes from the west between 1780 and 1820 these traditions were arguably poised to bring forth some form of islamic enlightenment but over the course of the nineteenth century they were overcome by the twin forces of islamic reformism and western education this book, written over the past twenty years, is the first full-length treatment in english of this important body of islamic scholars, teachers and leaders based in large part on their writings, records and private papers, it addresses a variety of issues: the establishment of specific traditions of scholarship and mysticism in eighteenth-century awadh; the place of these traditions in perso-islamic culture from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries; the traditions and values of the farangi mahall family; and the attempts of muslim intellectuals to respond to the challenges presented by british rule and western culture the work of the farangi mahallis is also placed in the context of an islamic world system based on shared systems of formal and spiritual knowledge this book is addressed to all who are seriously interested in the religious and intellectual history of india and to students of islam</p><p></p><h2>Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story</h2><p>The author discusses his childhood during the 1950s, the tortures of concealing his homosexuality, the bigotry he has encountered, and much more. By the author of Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir. 15,000 first printing. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Paul Monette first made a name for himself in 1978 with his debut novel, <i>Taking Care of Mrs. Carroll</i>, a comic romp with serious overtones. He established himself as a writer of popular fiction with three more novels before he and his lover were both diagnosed with HIV. In 1988 he wrote <i>On Borrowed Time</i>, a memoir of living with AIDS and of his lover's death. The passion and anger that fueled <i>On Borrowed Time</i> surfaces again in 1992's <i>Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story</i>, his National Book Award-winning autobiography. Although it follows the traditional structure of the autobiography and bildungsroman--early family life, education, reflections on how art influenced the subject's view of life--<i>Becoming a Man</i> also filters Monette's story through two central facts: the closet and AIDS. Monette writes of the pain of being closeted, the effect it had on his writing, and how it shaped (and often destroyed) his relationships. Monette's fear and fury at AIDS and homophobia heighten the same skill and imagination he put into his fiction. This vision--poetic yet highly political, angry yet infused with the love of life--is what transforms <i>Becoming a Man</i> from simple autobiography into an intense record of struggle and salvation. Paul Monette did not lead a life different from many gay men--he struggled courageously with his family, his sexuality, his AIDS diagnosis--but in bearing witness to his and others' pain, he creates a personal testimony that illuminates the darkest corners of our culture even as it finds unexpected reserves of hope.<p>Paul Monette (1945-1995) is the author of many books, including seven novels, four volumes of poetry, and several highly praised nonfiction works, such as <em>Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir</em>. In 1992, he received the National Book Award for <em>Becoming a Man</em>. He died of AIDS complications in 1995.</p></p><h2>Dorothea Lange: Photographs Of A Lifetime: An Aperture Monograph</h2><p>Reprinted for the first time, this is the most comprehensive collection of the photographer's work ever published.

Readers enter her world with exquisite anticipation, and experience a rich variety of characters and class: aristocrats living in luxury, flower sellers on street corners, ladies of the evening seeking customers on gaslit streets, gentlemen in hansom cabs en route to erotic diversions unknown in their Mayfair mansions. Now Perry gives her myriad fans the book they&#x2019;ve been waiting for&#x2014;the novel in which William Monk breaks through the wall of amnesia and discovers at last who he once was.<br><br><b>DEATH OF A STRANGER<br><br></b>For the prostitutes of Leather Lane, nurse Hester Monk&#x2019;s clinic is a lifeline, providing medicine, food, and a modicum of peace&#x2014;especially welcome since lately their ailments have escalated from bruises and fevers to broken bones and knife wounds. At the moment, however, the mysterious death of railway magnate Nolan Baltimore in a sleazy neighborhood brothel overshadows all else. Whether he fell or was pushed, the shocking question in everyone&#x2019;s mind is: What was such a pillar of respectability doing in a seedy place of sin? <br><br>Meanwhile, brilliant private investigator William Monk acquires a new client, a mysterious beauty who asks him to ascertain beyond a shadow of a doubt whether or not her fianc�, an executive in Nolan Baltimore&#x2019;s thriving railway firm, has become enmeshed in fraudulent practices that could ruin him.<br><br>As Hester ventures into violent streets to learn who is responsible for the brutal abuse of her patients, Monk embarks upon a journey into the English countryside, where the last rails are being laid for a new line. But the sight of tracks stretching into the distance revives memories once stripped from his consciousness by amnesia&#x2014;as a past almost impossible to bear returns, eerily paralleling a fresh tragedy that has already begun its inexorable unfolding.</p><p>Private enquiry agent William Monk is hired to investigate a potential case of fraud in the construction of a new railway line. His client is the fianc�e of a man she fears is embroiled in the scheme, and Monk's investigation causes a strange sense of d�j� vu--a former policeman afflicted with a case of amnesia concerning his prior life, Monk finds both the case and its milieu unsettlingly familiar. His case is somehow connected to the death of a railway magnate in a sleazy area of London where Monk's wife Hester, a nurse, operates a shelter for abused prostitutes. The women have been doubly victimized by an extortion scheme in which the dead man, who turns out to have been Monk's employer during his "lost" years, may have been involved. More than an ingenious way to fill in Monk's backstory, Anne Perry's newest mystery featuring the enigmatic investigator deepens the reader's understanding of an unusual and compelling protagonist and brings Victorian-era England vividly to life. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>&#x201c;Few mystery writers this side of Arthur Conan Doyle can evoke Victorian London with such relish for detail and mood.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i></b><br><b>&#x201c;Perry can write a Victorian mystery that would make Dickens&#x2019;s eyes pop.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br></b><br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Not So Big Life: Making Room for What Really Matters</h2><p>Have you ever found yourself asking, &#x201c;Is this all there is to life?&#x201d; Or wondering if this bigger life you have created is actually a better life? And do you wonder how it all got so out of control?<br><br>In her groundbreaking bestseller <i>The Not So Big House</i>, architect Sarah Susanka showed us a new way to inhabit our houses by creating homes that were better&#x2013;not bigger<i>.</i> Now, in <i>The Not So Big Life</i>, Susanka takes her revolutionary philosophy to another dimension by showing us a new way to inhabit our lives<i>.<br></i><br>Most of us have lives that are as cluttered with unwanted obligations as our attics are cluttered with things. The bigger-is-better idea that triggered the explosion of McMansions has spilled over to give us McLives. For many of us, our ability to find the time to do what we want to do has come to a grinding halt. Now we barely have time to take a breath before making the next call on our cell phone, while at the same time messaging someone else on our Blackberry. Our schedules are chaotic and overcommitted, leaving us so stressed that we are numb, yet we wonder why we cannot fall asleep at night.<br><br>In <i>The Not So Big Life,</i> Susanka shows us that it is possible to take our finger off the fast-forward button, and to our surprise we find how effortless and rewarding this change can be. We do not have to lead a monastic life or give up the things we love. In fact, the real joy of leading a not so big life is discovering that the life we love has been there the entire time. Through simple exercises and inspiring stories, Susanka shows us that all we need to do is make small shifts in our day&#x2013;subtle movements that open our minds as if we were finally opening the windows to let in fresh air.<br><br><i>The Not So Big Life </i>reveals that form and function serve not only architectural aims but life goals as well. Just as we can tear down interior walls to reveal space, we can tear down our fears and assumptions to open up new possibilities. The result is that we quickly discover we have all the space and time we need for the things in our lives that really matter. But perhaps the greatest reward is the discovery that small changes can yield enormous results. In her elegant, clear style, Susanka convinces us that less truly is more&#x2013;much more.</p><p>Sarah Susanka is a bestselling author, architect, and cultural visionary.

Don&#x2019;t open the door to the study<br>and begin reading. Take down a musical instrument.<br>Let the beauty we love be what we do.<br>There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.<br>&#x2014;RUMI<br><br>What Are We Missing?<br><br>We are facing an enormous problem in our lives today. It&#x2019;s so big we can hardly see it, and it&#x2019;s right in our face all day, every day. We&#x2019;re all living too big lives, crammed from top to toe with activities, urgencies, and obligations that seem absolute. There&#x2019;s no time to take a breath, no time to look for the source of the problem. We are almost desperate for a solution. If we stop and consider what our lives would be like if things got much faster, we might feel overwhelmed by hopelessness and futility. We just don&#x2019;t have any more to give. We&#x2019;re at the end of our rope.<br><br>We need to remodel the way we are living, but not in a way that gives us more of the same kinds of space we already have; that would simply create an even bigger life. What we need is a remodeling that allows us to experience what&#x2019;s already here but to experience it differently, so that it delights us rather than drives us crazy.<br><br>Your life is a lot like the house you live in. It has some things that you like and some that you find irritating. It has rooms that are used constantly and others that you visit only once in a blue moon. It has features that need frequent maintenance and others that will last for decades without your attention. Almost all of us would engage in some remodeling of our house if we had the time and the money. In an ideal world all the shortcomings of our home would be remodeled to fit the way we&#x2019;d like to live, with plenty of room for the things we hold most dear.<br><br>The real issue is that we want to feel at home both in our houses and in our lives, and we try to do this by tweaking the things we are aware of, the things we assume must be the problem, such as not enough space and not enough time. But some problems are less visible; they&#x2019;re about qualities rather than quantities, so they are more difficult to identify, articulate, and resolve. We can&#x2019;t create more of a sense of home if we don&#x2019;t understand where that feeling comes from. In your house, for example, if you feel upset every time you return home from work because you have to enter through the laundry room, pushing your way past baskets of clothes waiting to be washed, unfolded mounds of sheets and towels, and a miscellaneous trail of kids&#x2019; coats and boots, you may require an architect to point out to you that yours is not a well-designed entry sequence. It&#x2019;s not the laundry itself that&#x2019;s the problem; it&#x2019;s that you have to pass through it to enter the house.<br><br>Our lives are just the same. We think the problem is our job or our boss or our child care arrangement or our spouse, and we keep trying to fix those things, only to find new frustrations popping up once we get free of the offending situation, making it impossible for us to feel at home in our lives. The problem isn&#x2019;t what we think it is. Like the process of identifying that it&#x2019;s the entry sequence that takes you through the laundry and not the laundry itself that&#x2019;s the problem, fixing the problems in our lives involves understanding what underlies these events. What&#x2019;s needed is a dramatic shift in perspective, and architecture and design provide remarkably useful metaphors for helping us to see what that shift might look like.<br><br>When you remodel a house, you don&#x2019;t need to change a lot of things in order to shift the character of the house, but you do need to evaluate what isn&#x2019;t working and determine what you would like to have room for but don&#x2019;t. Then you need to compose a good design solution that uses what already exists but modifies it here and there to accommodate the new functions. After that you must develop a thorough set of blueprints that record all the decisions made. And finally, to live the changes, you must build. This last step may seem obvious, but it&#x2019;s actually the easiest to miss. No amount of planning will bring about change. It&#x2019;s the actual implementation that allows things to shift.<br><br>In remodeling your life it&#x2019;s the same. You can read all manner of books and dream all manner of dreams, but only when you decide that you&#x2019;re really going to do something differently, and follow through with the implementation of those plans, will things begin to change. You have to start living what you&#x2019;ve learned, and not just on Saturday afternoons when you have some spare time. The lessons have to be woven into your everyday life and lived just as reflexively as the acts of washing your hands and brushing your teeth. Solving the problem has two parts: first, we need knowledge in order to see things in a new way; then, we need to integrate what we&#x2019;ve learned by being in our lives differently and doing things in a new way.<br><br>To accomplish a life remodeling, we need a blueprint, along with instructions for putting the plan into place in our lives. That&#x2019;s what this book offers you, the remodeler. When we&#x2019;re done, the contents of your days will still be quite recognizable to you, but there will be room to do what you&#x2019;ve always wanted to do and the freedom to experience more of the potential you know is waiting within you to be revealed and realized. If you engage the steps prescribed, integrating them as suggested, there will be change, and you will experience things differently, and with new vitality.<br><br>So how do we get there? Let&#x2019;s take a look at the key ingredients that go into the making of a Not So Big Life. These will serve as a thumbnail sketch for each of the plans we&#x2019;ll develop more fully in the chapters that follow.<br><br>one � Developing a Blueprint for a New Way of Living<br><br>Because we tend to compartmentalize our lives&#x2014;to see our working world as one thing, our home life as another, and our desire for connection with our inner nature as yet another&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t really live in the way we know should be possible.<br><br>This compartmentalizing is similar to the way we separate room from room with walls. A house that&#x2019;s full of separate rooms that are connected to one another only by narrow doorways can feel claustrophobic no matter how large the overall square footage. What gives a sense of space is the extent of the connecting views between rooms. The more you can see of an adjacent room, by opening up a wall with an archway or an interior window, the more spacious you&#x2019;ll feel the house to be.<br><br>In our lives we need to make the same kinds of connections between realms, removing the barriers to flow so that we can feel as alive and whole at work as we do when we are engaged in doing the things we love. What is needed is an integration of what we long for and what we work for. We don&#x2019;t have to sacrifice one for the other. Both can coexist in deeply satisfying harmony if we learn to understand ourselves better from the inside out.<br><br>two � Noticing What Inspires You<br><br>When I first begin working with architectural clients, I ask them to show me pictures from magazines or from other houses they know that delight them, as well as their favorite places in their own house. These are the features that will make them look forward to returning home each day, so they are really important to a sense of well-being and a sense of home.<br><br>For example, I remember one woman, a mother of three active boys, showing me a picture of a small alcove off a family room, with a comfortable wingback chair positioned to look out across the vista of prairie beyond. When I asked her what in particular she was responding to in the photograph, she told me that it was the promise of a time when she could do nothing more than sit and look, without any obligations, and without her to-do list nagging at her. The picture captured a quality of being that she was missing in her life. Such a place, when designed into her remodeled home, would inspire her to find this kind of time for herself.<br><br>Another client, a man in his late fifties who was the CEO of a midsize manufacturing company, showed me a dog-eared photograph of his grandmother&#x2019;s summer cabin&#x2014;a place where he&#x2019;d spent many happy sun-drenched months as a child. For him, the character of the structure, a simple clapboard house with no frills or embellishments, spoke to him of the calmness and ease he had felt during those summers.

Reprint. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Gates, director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1991 to 1993, began in an entry level position and rose to the top. His insider&#39;s account of the Cold War, CIA operations and the unraveling of the Soviet Union is sprinkled with revelations including the fact that 1983 was the most dangerous year in U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations and that both the CIA and KGB sponsored countless &#34;black operations&#34; designed to embarrass and discredit the other side. Gates also reveals that he secretly met with KGB foreign operations chief Vladimir Kryuchkov on two separate occasions and how the CIA often acted in contempt of Congress. While none of this may come as a huge surprise, it never fails to shock when it&#39;s laid out in black and white by someone who was on the inside.ROBERT M. GATES was Director of Central Intelligence from November 1991 to January 1993.</p><h2>Making Tracks: The Rise Of Blondie</h2><p>In the photographs of Chris Stein and words of Debbie Harry, <i>Making Tracks</i> details the story of Blondie, whose career propelled them from the depths of the Bowery to international renown as the hottest rock group in the world. Victor Bockris aided in the formation of the text and selection of photographs, which also provides an intimate portrait of the unique collaboration between Debbie and Chris.</p><p>Debbie Harry is probably the single most interesting and important woman in the history of rock. Well, maybe not, but all rock bios should start with hyperbole, and if anyone deserves hyperbole, it's Harry. This photo book/biography works wildly well in both its media. Chris Stein's pictures of Harry, Blondie, and the New York rock scene are not only fun in a nostalgic way, they're damn good pictures that you can stare at for hours--even without having taken the drugs that inspired them. And the story of Debbie Harry's life, as written by Harry and rock critic Victor Bockris, is two steps past weird. Who knew that Debbie was a flower child in the '60s and saw the Doors, Janis Joplin and the Velvet Underground live at some of their most celebrated shows? Or what about Debbie's stint in the psychedelic folk band Wind in the Willows? Or that Debbie was 35 years old when Blondie hit it big? Her career crosses and overruns so many moments and people in rock history that reading her bio is like driving through rock &amp; roll heaven. And, frankly, the fact that the book is full of photos of the cutest rock star in history doesn't hurt. A must for fans of Harry and historians of rock. <i>--James DiGiovanna</i><b>Lauren Cowen</b> is an award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> , the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> , and other publications. <b>Victor Bockris</b> has written about the cultural heroes of the twentieth century for over thirty years.

Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Colonial Bostonians introduce themselves through free-verse vignettes that describe their work and their feelings about the current political situation. As errand boy Ethan moves about the city, he links the people together. From the printer, who distributes the news of a gathering to be held, to the baker, the school mistress, the shoemaker, the milliner, and so on, he covers a territory that ends up at the Old South Meeting House. There, the Sons of Liberty decide to protest the governor's decision regarding some shipments of British tea. Winters's poems flow well, but they employ somewhat complex vocabulary and syntax. A glossary is included to help children with terms such as "fripperies," "journeyman," "limner," "hackle," and "wag-on-the-wall." Historical notes go into more detail about each person's job and compare similar positions in the northern and southern colonies. Both men and women are portrayed; while most characters are white, a Native American woman and a male African slave are also featured. The political sentiments described include Patriots, Loyalists, and some in-between. The watercolor and ink illustrations add humor and drama through shifting perspectives and well-detailed settings full of period details. Ethan appears in each picture, and children will enjoy following his route and sharing his reactions to the varied scenes he observes. A unique presentation for all libraries.&#x2014;<i>Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Stanley Oxenford, director of a pharmaceutical research company, has everything riding on a drug he is developing to fight a lethal virus. Several others are interested in his success too: his children, at home for Christmas with their offspring, have their eyes on the money he will make; Toni Gallo, head of his security team and recently forced to resign from the police, is betting her career on keeping it safe; an ambitious local television reporter sniffs a story, even if he has to bend the facts to tell it; and a violent trio of thugs is on their way to steal it, with a client already waiting.</p><p>As the storm worsens and the group is laid under siege by the elements, the emotional sparks crackle and dark secrets are uncovered threaten to drive Stanley and his family apart for ever.</p><p>Filled with startling twists, Whiteout is the ultimate knife-edge drama from an international bestselling author who is in a class by himself.</p></p><p><p>Ken Follett was only twenty-seven when he wrote the award-winning novel EYE OF THE NEEDLE, which became an international bestseller. He has since written sixteen equally successful novels including, most recently, HORNET FLIGHT. He is also author of the non-fiction bestseller ON WINGS OF EAGLES. He lives with his family in London and Hertfordshire.</p>Bestseller Follett sets his sights on biological terrorism, pumping old-school adrenaline into this new breed of thriller. Ex-policewoman Antonia "Toni" Gallo, head of security at a boutique pharmaceuticals company, has discovered that two doses of an experimental drug&#x2014;developed as a potential cure for the deadly Madoba-2 virus&#x2014;have vanished from her top-secret laboratory. This mystery is a precursor to a more serious crime being planned by Kit Oxenford, the gambling-addicted son of the company's founder, Stanley Oxenford. Kit, deeply in debt to mobster Harry Mac, sees a raid on his father's lab as a chance to score enough money to disappear and start anew in another country. Some characters are a bit familiar&#x2014;the pesky, unprincipled journalist; the imbecilic police detective&#x2014;but others, the mobster's psychopathic daughter in particular, show idiosyncratic originality. After a long buildup, the burglary is set in motion, and Kit's best-laid plans begin to fall apart. Eventually, good guys and bad guys end up at the Oxenford family estate, trapped in the house by a fierce snowstorm as they battle one another over the material stolen from the laboratory. A romance between the recently widowed Stanley and Toni and the unexpected addition of Toni's comically addled mother thicken the plot as Follett's agonizingly protracted, nail-biter ending drags readers to the very edge of their seats and holds them captive until the last villain is satisfactorily dispatched. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through it all, Pooh remains the whimsical philosopher and staunch friend, captivating children as he has for generations.</p></p><p>Pooh straps on his backpack and goes out searching for honey with his pal Piglet in this adorable new plush toy and board book format.Alexander Lenard was a Hungarian writer, poet, artist, linguist and teacher. His Latin translation of Winnie-the-Pooh, which took seven years to complete, was published in the UK in 1960 and immediately became a bestseller. A.A. Milne wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920. Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). E. H. Shepard famously illustrated both Winnie-the-Pooh and The Wind in the Willows though, like A.

In <b>Loose Lips</b>, Rita Mae Brown revisits Runnymede and the beloved characters introduced in <b>Six of One</b> and <b>Bingo</b>, serving up an exuberant portrayal of small-town sins and Southern mores, set against a backdrop of homefront life during World War II.<br><br>"I'm afraid life is passing me by," Louise told her sister.<br><br>"No, it's not," Juts said. "Life can't pass us by. We are life."<br><br>In the picturesque town of Runnymede, everyone knows everyone else's business, and the madcap antics of the battling Hunsenmeir sisters, Julia (Juts) and Louise, have kept the whole town agog ever since they were children. Now, in the fateful year of 1941, with America headed for war, the sisters are inching toward forty...and Juts is unwise enough to mention that unspeakable reality to her sister.<br><br>The result is a huge brawl that litters Cadwalder's soda fountain with four hundred dollars' worth of broken glass. To pay the debt, the sisters choose a surprisingly new direction. Suddenly they are joint owners of The Curl 'n' Twirl beauty salon, where discriminating ladies meet to be primped, permed, and pampered while dishing the town's latest dirt.<br><br>As Juts and Louise become Runnymede's most unlikely new career women, each faces her share of obstacles. Restless Juts can't shake her longing for a baby, while holier-than-thou Louise is fit to be tied over her teenage daughter's headlong rush toward scandal. As usual, the sisters rarely see eye to eye, and there are plenty of opinions to go around. Even the common bond of patriotic duty brings wildly unexpected results when the twosome joins the Civil Air Patrol, watching the night sky for German Stukas. But loose lips can sink even the closest relationships, and Juts and Louise are about to discover that some things are best left unsaid.<br><br>Spanning a decade in the lives of Louise, Juts, and their nearest and dearest, including the incomparable Celeste Chalfonte, <b>Loose Lips</b> is an unforgettable tale of love and loss and the way life can always throw you a curveball. By turns poignant and hilarious, it is deepened by Rita Mae Brown's unerring insight into the human heart.</p><p>In <i>Bingo</i> and <i>Six of One</i>, Rita Mae Brown made a name for herself--and the unforgettable Hunsenmeir sisters--with her talented depictions of early 1940s life in a small southern town. Now, in <i>Loose Lips</i>, we follow the continuously strained relationship of the outrageous siblings, Julia (Juts) and Louise (Wheezie). <p> Juts and Wheezie can't pass up a chance to push each other's buttons, and their joint ownership of a beauty salon in this latest installment creates many opportunities to do so. As Wheezie faces her 40th birthday with grim denial, Juts considers motherhood, and the rest of the town braces for their inevitable clashes.</p><p> Brown's snappy dialogue and artful situations skillfully communicate the surprising complexity of small town life and sibling relationships. Between the moments of straight comedy (a panicked confusion between bombers and geese makes a great running joke), the meatier issues of adoption, fidelity, piety, and, most importantly, loyalty, are considered, making <i>Loose Lips</i> both a hilarious and heartfelt read. <i>--Nancy R.E.

The car is occupied by a young Hawaiian, Tom King, who, although not seriously hurt, needs help from the Hollisters to get out of his car. While resting in their home, he tells them he has come all the way across the country in search of a log book from an unidentified clipper ship.

This log book is important to Tom for it will prove his grandfather and grandmother were married on this ship giving him evidence that he is legally entitled to the inheritance left by his uncle. How is this mystery connected with Gregory Grant and Lisa Sarno, the famous movie stars, and a motion picture in which the Hollister children have an active part?

Clarence Bass discovered that he could look as good at 70 as he did much earlier and encourages readers to have the same great expectations for themselves - at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and beyond. In Great Expectations, he provides both the example and the science to show that the body will keep responding to the demands of sensible training far longer than most people think possible. Vibrant health, fitness, and leanness are there for those who choose to train, eat, and live well. What&#39;s more, suffering is not required or even helpful. To be truly successful over the long term you must enjoy your diet and training. The details are in Great Expectations.</p><p>The dedication and reverence that Clarence Bass has brought to the study of his body and, by extension bodies in general is not only inspirational; it is to my knowledge unique in the world of physical culture. The combination of Clarence&#39;s unwavering focus and his high-octane mind has already produced many fine books, but his latest provides a depth of detail about his own fascinating life as well as a wealth of accessible and accurate information about training, eating, and living well. Read it and you&#39;ll be amazed, inspired, and much better informed about how to remain strong, lean, and fit for a much longer time than you ever thought possible.

Millions of years ago, the star, its fuel dwindling, had gone nova, hurling its outer layers into space and ravaging the worlds that had once orbited it. No longer a nuclear furnace, the star still glowed with bright white light created by the heat of its collapse into a sphere the size of a world like Earth. Over the course of another billion years, the star would expend that heat and gradually cool.<br><br> Humanity arrived, in ships that needed the mass of stars to create jump points allowing those ships to cross light years of distance in a few weeks. The star was given a name, Jatayu, but with only a few battered rocks still circling it, humans went onward to other stars that still warmed worlds where men and women could find new homes. Jatayu was nothing but a waypoint, a place the ships of humans had to go through to get to places they wanted to go.<br><br> But one day some humans came to stay. They brought a small outpost that they placed in orbit about the white dwarf star and claimed ownership of Jatayu.<br><br> Billions of years after its birth, war followed humanity to the small, bright star.<br><br> �Leaving jump space at Jatayu in five . . . four . . . three . . .�<br><br> Commodore Erik Hopkins, formerly of Earth Fleet, braced himself for the familiar disorientation and dizziness that accompanied a drop out of jump space. He wasn't otherwise worried. Freedom of Space Navigation Operation. There was a checklist for that, and every item had been checked off. The destroyer Claymore, originally known as the Garibaldi when she was part of Earth Fleet, was at Standard Alert Condition Two, just as mandated by the checklist. The freighter they were escorting would come out of jump space behind Claymore, and they would proceed through Jatayu Star System, breaking the unofficial blockade of Glenlyon Star System. It had all been planned out.<br><br> Scatha Star System had claimed control of Jatayu, a claim without legal merit but one that Scatha might try to enforce against any unescorted freighter. With other star systems within reach of Glenlyon either claimed or controlled by Scatha, or by its partners in strong-arming their neighbors, Apulu Star System and Turan Star System, trade between Glenlyon and the rest of human space had been choked off. Glenlyon faced the alternatives of either fighting or submission, but, unwilling to make that stark choice, had instead decided on trying to call what it hoped was a bluff by Scatha.<br><br> Which was where Claymore and Commodore Hopkins came in. He wasn't worried about the outcome. Earth Fleet had had a checklist for everything, and checklists for the checklists. That was how Earth Fleet got things done, and Commodore Hopkins had risen to rank by making sure he adhered to those checklists. There wasn't much left of Earth Fleet anymore, mainly the men and women still tasked with decommissioning the last remaining warships, archiving the remaining data and records, and preparing to turn out the last lights and lock the last doors. Hopkins himself, along with the great majority of the crew and the Claymore herself, had been declared surplus years ago and been forced to find new employment out among the new worlds being rapidly settled far from Earth. Glenlyon had been a decent place to work with, but Hopkins and most of the crew still thought of themselves as being from Earth rather than their new home, and Hopkins still ran everything by the rules that Earth Fleet had once lived by.<br><br> As the destroyer left jump the formless, bland gray of jump space vanished from the displays on Claymore's bridge, suddenly replaced by the familiar star-spangled black of normal space. One of those white dots was the star Jatayu itself, only a speck from the jump point five light hours away where Claymore had arrived. Velocity couldn't be measured in jump space, but back in normal space Claymore was only traveling at point zero two light speed, a crawl for a warship, because of the need to stay close to the plodding freighter she was escorting.<br><br> Dizzy from the drop out of jump space, Hopkins was still trying to focus on the display before his command seat when Claymore shuddered, then jolted as if a giant had slammed a hammer against her hull. Alarms blared throughout the ship.<br><br> "Situation!" ordered Captain Kanda Shade, commanding officer of the Claymore, as she also tried to shake off the disorientation.<br><br> "We're under attack!" the weapons watch officer reported. "Two opponents. Tentative ID-"<br><br> Claymore jerked again, hard. More alarms sounded.<br><br> "Shield failure amidships! Hull breaches in two compartments!"<br><br> Hopkins finally forced his eyes into focus, staring at his display. There were the two attackers, who must have been waiting at the jump exit for Claymore. And right behind Claymore was the freighter Bruce Monroe, having just left jump space as well.<br><br> "Attackers are a Sword Class destroyer and a Founders Class destroyer."<br><br> Hopkins opened his mouth to issue an order but hesitated.<br><br> The relevant checklists had automatically appeared on his display. When Attacked By Superior Numbers, the first item demanded "Accelerate at Full." But the list for Freedom of Navigation Operations had a block for "Maintain Close Escort of Freighter(s)." One list demanded that he order Claymore to accelerate at full, but the other demanded that he stay close to the Bruce Monroe.<br><br> Claymore jerked again.<br><br> "Another hit amidships! We've lost Particle Cannon One!"<br><br> "Shields at full!" Commander Shade ordered from her own checklist. "Main propulsion-" She paused, staring at her display where the other two checklists offered the same incompatible choices. "Commodore?"<br><br> Hopkins shook his head, wracked by indecision. "I don't- We can't-"<br><br> Two more jolts. "Main propulsion down by thirty percent! Shields have collapsed!"<br><br> The Commodore frowned at his display. Follow the checklists. He knew he had to follow the checklists. "We have to . . ." He looked helplessly at Shade. "Captain . . . ?"<br><br> Shade shook her head, baffled. "We're supposed to . . ."<br><br> Claymore groaned and shook as more blows landed. The lights went out, replaced by the dimmer glow of emergency lanterns. "Grapeshot launchers disabled. Particle Cannon Two destroyed! Serious structural damage amidships!"<br><br> "Orders, sir?" another watch stander pleaded.<br><br> Hopkins hesitated.<br><br> Shade tried to read through both checklists again.<br><br> A shudder ran through Claymore, followed by a deep boom that rattled through the ship as she broke in two.<br><br> Hopkins felt an overwhelming sense of relief as a new checklist appeared on the emergency display that had replaced his usual one. He knew what to do. It was right there, item one on the list. "Abandon ship!"<br><br> He was still running down Preparatory-to-Abandoning-Ship items on the list when a barrage of grapeshot struck and tore through the bridge of the wreck that had once been a destroyer.<br><br> Rob Geary, Senior Dock Officer for the orbital shipyard and station that was Glenlyon�s main link with space, glared at the image of Council Member Leigh Camagan on his desk display. �The government really expects me to step up again?�<br><br> "Yes," she replied. "You came through for Glenlyon three years ago, Rob."<br><br> "What do they think I can do? Claymore was totally destroyed, I'm told, half her crew dead. I sent Hopkins a message before Claymore left, warning him that it had taken him so long to prepare for that mission that Scatha had to have plenty of advance warning. Everyone on this station seemed to know about it." Rob paused, miserable as he thought of the dead. "I wish either I'd been wrong, or Hopkins had listened. Why has Saber remained in orbit here?"<br><br> Camagan made a face. "Commander Teosig was ordered out but kept finding reasons to delay. He was fired this morning."<br><br> "He should have been fired at least a year ago! I had to work with that guy whenever Saber was in dock for refit. All he cared about was looking good to Commodore Hopkins, so he'd do his best to avoid actually doing anything that might mar his reputation. I told you all about that!"<br><br> "Yes, you did," Leigh Camagan agreed, exasperated. "And I told the rest of the council, who deferred to Commodore Hopkins, who as you say thought Commander Teosig was a perfect commanding officer. Why are you venting on me? Because I was chosen to ask you to return to service?"<br><br> Rob paused, angry with himself and with the universe. "I'm sorry. What is it the government wants me to do?" he asked again.<br><br> "Assume command of Saber and all fleet assets to defend Glenlyon."<br><br> "Saber is the only fleet asset left! Are they offering me a temporary, unofficial rank of lieutenant again?"<br><br> "Commander," Camagan replied. "Official rank of commander. And status as Commodore in charge of all fleet assets."<br><br> "They must really be scared."<br><br> "They are. Glenlyon is being choked to death by the grip that Scatha and Apulu and Turan have established over the trade routes out here. If we can't find a way to break through, Glenlyon will have no choice but to submit."<br><br> "Submit?"<br><br> Camagan's glare wasn't aimed at Rob this time. "What they did at Hesta. A so-called trade office that effectively ended up controlling not just trade but also the government."<br><br> "We came out here to be free," Rob said, feeling bleak.<br><br> "A lot of people did. But it has become obvious that others came out here to start building empires."<br><br> "What about Mele Darcy?" He owed Mele that concern after what she had done three years ago to defeat Scatha on the ground.<br><br> "We need her, too. I pushed through a vote to finally create a small Marine force to assist the fleet. Mele Darcy is being offered command of that force. It's only a Marine captain's rank, but it's official."<br><br> "Who will the Marines work for?" Rob asked, remembering some stories he had heard about the ground forces commander.<br><br> "They'll work for you. They'll be part of the fleet. You'll be in charge of Mele Darcy. I'm not sure anyone else would take that particular job."<br><br> "I need to talk to Ninja before I agree to anything."<br><br> "Of course." Leigh Camagan sighed. "Give your wife Lyn my best."<br><br> "You know Lyn is fine with you calling her Ninja. All of her friends call her that."<br><br> "I imagine that Ninja won't be feeling too friendly toward me because of this. I hope she doesn't decide to hack all of my personal data."<br><br> The walk through the orbital station to his home was short, one of the perks of being Senior Dock Officer. Usually he was happy about that, but today Rob wished he had more time to think before reaching the door to his quarters. In addition to his own name a small sign advertised Ninja IT Consulting.<br><br> Ninja, as usual, was seated before several displays as she worked. "Hey," Rob said, sitting down beside her.<br><br> "Hey, yourself." Ninja gave him a sharp look. "Don't bother summarizing your talk with Camagan."<br><br> "You listened in?"<br><br> "When the governing council makes a high priority call to my husband, I think I deserve to know what's going on."<br><br> "That call was secure. Triple encrypted," Rob pointed out.<br><br> "Oh, Rob, how many times have we gone over the secure thing? It's a myth." Ninja looked away, as if focusing on one of the displays to the other side of her. "So, you're going."<br><br> "I said I needed to talk to you before I decided."<br><br> "Nice words. You and I both know what you want to do."<br><br> "What I think I have to do," Rob said. He looked toward the door to the second bedroom. "Is Little Ninja asleep?" Even though their toddler daughter's name was Dani, she'd refused to answer to anything but Little Ninja ever since Mele Darcy had called her that about six months ago.<br><br> "Yeah. What, are you feeling a bit guilty for abandoning your family?"<br><br> "Ninja-"<br><br> "No!" She turned a furious gaze on him, a dark memory vivid in her eyes. "I've never been able to forget how I felt when everyone thought you'd died on Squall. Do you know how that felt, Rob?"<br><br> "No," he admitted, unable to meet her eyes.<br><br> "So who'd tell Little Ninja if her daddy never comes home, huh? And her Aunt Mele if something happens to her? You know how much Little Ninja loves her Aunt Mele. But that'd be my job, too, wouldn't it? And our next project?" She tapped her abdomen, where the two months of pregnancy barely showed. "Who tells that kid he'll never see his father? Is that going to be my job, too?"<br><br> He knew what was driving her anger. She was afraid for him, afraid for what might happen to him and to her and their children. She needed to vent that fear, to let him know how it was affecting her. And she was doubtless also angry that fate had once more put them in a position where she had to nurse such fears.<br><br> And having let him know, she'd probably never bring it up again. Because she knew the pressure he was under, that he'd need her support, and that arguing with fate was worse than useless.<br><br> What right did he have to put her through that? Rob bit his lip, trying to come up with words, and finally looked up at her again. "Ninja, I'd decided I should go because you, and those kids, deserved a free world to live in. I really don't want to leave. If it would hurt you that much-"<br><br> "Oh, shut up, Rob! You and I both know you have to go! Because that's the idealistic idiot that I was stupid enough to fall in love with and marry! And our kids will probably inherit your sense of duty and idealism so someday I'll have to see them off on some harebrained noble missions, too! And it'll be your fault! But you had better come back again, do you hear me? You come back, or I swear I will tell these kids that you were a fool and they should never be anything like you!"<br><br> He looked at her helplessly. "What is it you want?"<br><br> Ninja shook her head. "You figure that out for yourself."<br><br> "Do you think I want to do this?" Rob demanded. "Leave you and Little Ninja? Go out there and . . . watch men and women die because of orders I gave? Do you think I want to do that again?"<br><br> She looked at him without saying anything for a few moments. "You say their names sometimes when you're asleep. Did you know that? The names of the ones who didn't come back. I hear you say those names, and I don't know what to do." She reached out and embraced him, her arms gripping him tightly. "And then I think of Kosatka, and how many people would have died there if you weren't such an idiot. And how you got most of the crew of Squall home when it seemed hopeless. And here at Glenlyon, where Scatha would probably have been running everything by now. People like you and Mele go out and do things like this because you think you have to, and people like me and Little Ninja just hope and pray you come back each time."</p><h2>Solomon on Sex</h2><p>This is an excellent book that looks at the book of Song of Solomon in the bible and gives a clear, understandable commentary. Couple that with the author&#39;s own insight, and practical applications, it has the power to change your views on the book of Song of Solomon and your marriage. With doses of humor and keen insights, this book is a must for every married couple.</p><p></p><h2>The Kite Runner</h2><p>Twelve year old Amir is desperate to win the approval of his father Baba, one of the richest and most respected merchants in Kabul. He has failed to do so through academia or brawn, but the one area where they connect is the annual kite fighting tournament. Amir is determined not just to win the competition but to run the last kite and bring it home triumphantly, to prove to his father that he has the makings of a man. His loyal friend Hassan is the best kite runner that Amir has ever seen, and he promises to help him - for Hassan always helps Amir out of trouble. But Hassan is a Shi&#39;a Muslim and this is 1970s Afghanistan. Hassan is taunted and jeered at by Amir&#39;s school friends; he is merely a servant living in a shack at the back of Amir&#39;s house. So why does Amir feel such envy towards his friend? Then, what happens to Hassan on the afternoon of the tournament is to shatter all their lives, and define their futures. When Russia invades Afghanistan, Amir and Baba escape to San Francisco, where Baba fades but Amir feels that at last he can succeed. But he is still haunted by guilt and he knows that his past will not let him go. The destructive rule of the Northern Alliance, followed by the even more terrifying and oppressive Taliban have destroyed the country that Amir knows, but the hearts of men cannot be suppressed. Amir must return to Afghanistan to search for salvation, and perhaps his life-altering mistakes can be redeemed. This is a moving, courageous story of love, loyalty, secrets and vengeance, and of a country and a boy whose footsteps cannot be retraced, as the events and decisions resonate and alter them for ever.</p><p>In his debut novel, <i>The Kite Runner</i>, Khaled Hosseini accomplishes what very few contemporary novelists are able to do. He manages to provide an educational and eye-opening account of a country's political turmoil--in this case, Afghanistan--while also developing characters whose heartbreaking struggles and emotional triumphs resonate with readers long after the last page has been turned over. And he does this on his first try.<p> <i>The Kite Runner</i> follows the story of Amir, the privileged son of a wealthy businessman in Kabul, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant. As children in the relatively stable Afghanistan of the early 1970s, the boys are inseparable. They spend idyllic days running kites and telling stories of mystical places and powerful warriors until an unspeakable event changes the nature of their relationship forever, and eventually cements their bond in ways neither boy could have ever predicted. Even after Amir and his father flee to America, Amir remains haunted by his cowardly actions and disloyalty. In part, it is these demons and the sometimes impossible quest for forgiveness that bring him back to his war-torn native land after it comes under Taliban rule. ("...I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded, not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.")</p><p> Some of the plot's turns and twists may be somewhat implausible, but Hosseini has created characters that seem so real that one almost forgets that <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a novel and not a memoir. At a time when Afghanistan has been thrust into the forefront of America's collective consciousness ("people sipping lattes at Starbucks were talking about the battle for Kunduz"), Hosseini offers an honest, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, but always heartfelt view of a fascinating land. Perhaps the only true flaw in this extraordinary novel is that it ends all too soon. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>"A wonderful work... This is one of those unforgettable stories that stay with you for years.

All this, and a rich slice of Afghan culture too: irresistible." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Like <b>Gone with the Wind</b>, this extraordinary first novel locates the personal struggles of everyday people in the terrible sweep of history.&#x201d; -- <i>People</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;To many Western readers, [Afghanistan&#x2019;s] can be an exhausting and bewildering history.

Hosseini is an exhilaratingly original writer with a gift for irony and a gentle, perceptive heart . . . one of the most lyrical, moving and unexpected novels of the year." -- <i>Denver Post</i></p><h2>The Trial Begins and On Socialist Realism</h2><p>Abram Tertz, one of the most important writers to emerge in the Soviet Union since World War II, came to prominence in 1959 when <i>On Socialist Realism</i> was published in the West. It was the first important critique of the central dogma of Soviet literature. It arrived with a novel. <i>The Trial Begins</i>, which was published in 1960. Other books followed these into the West, until in 1965 a respected literary scholar at the Gorky Institute, Andrei Sinyavsky was arrested, revealed to be Abram Tertz, tried, and sentenced to seven years in a forced labor camp.</p><p></p><h2>Marjorie Morningstar</h2><p>IN GREAT CONDITION.

The storyteller, a Taino Indian, tells of a time when the Earth was a waterless desert plain at the base of a tall mountain. A boy, looking for food, finds a seed that he saves in his pouch. He finds more and plants them on top of the mountain. A forest grows, and at the base of one tree a vine produces first a beautiful golden flower, then a pumpkin. The people are frightened by the strange noises coming from it, and they stay away. But one day two men struggle for the fruit until the vine breaks. The pumpkin rolls down the mountain and bursts open, releasing the sea and all the creatures in it. The people rush to the top of the mountain, which becomes their island home. The text is simple and lends itself to a storyteller's performance. The book is large enough to share with a group, and the words flow smoothly across the bottom of the pages without interrupting the illustrations. Sanchez's acrylic-and-gouache art creates a primitive setting with vibrant colors and angular designs. The characters' emotions are easily interpreted and contribute to the mood of the story. A worthy addition to any folktale collection.?Betty Teague, Blythe Academy of Languages, Greenville, SC<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Subtitled ``A Taino Myth From Puerto Rico,'' this is the legend of how water came to the world. Puerto Rico, according to its earliest inhabitants, was once a mountain in the middle of a vast dry plain. A child receives magic seeds that grow into a lush green forest on the mountaintop. In that forest, a vine produces a beautiful golden flower, and from the flower springs a great golden pumpkin. Two men fight over the pumpkin, and in their struggle they drop it. It rolls down the mountainside, bursts open on a rock, and out springs the sea, flooding the plain and making Puerto Rico the island it is today. Jaffe prefaces the story with an introduction to Taino storytelling tradition, then uses an afterword to provide more background information on these first people, including their fate at the hands of Columbus. The story is told in a simple, lyrical style that will quickly involve young listeners in the myth. S&nbsp;nchez's illustrations, done in acrylic and gouache, are alive with swirling color; his human figures, squat and thick, in keeping with the style of pre-Columbian art, have the round-eyed wonder and build of Roy Gerrard's many characters. A welcome addition to the folklore shelves. (Picture book/folklore. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Noted scholar John Hollander provides the thoughtful introduction and insightful annotations, and illustrator Miles Hyman brings the stories to life in nostalgic pictures that evoke an America gone by.<br></p><p>Grade 7-9 Each volume includes five to seven stories with original texts and full-color illustrations, a general introduction, a biography of the writer, and, for each story, a brief discussion of its theme, style, and/or characterization. In <i>O.

The latest volume in the Stories for Young People series serves up seven short stories by the celebrated American master of the form. Edited by a distinguished academic, the collection includes such well-known tales as "The Gift of the Magi," "The Last Leaf," and "Mammon and the Archer." The remaining four are lesser known, but all feature -O. -Henry's signature surprise endings. Illustrated in a style a bit reminiscent of Tomie dePaola's work, each story includes a slightly didactic introduction and definitions of potentially problematic words and phrases ("Mazuma," "Turkey Trust," "imputation of parsimony," etc.).

Said to be one of J.R.R. Tolkien's childhood favorites, <i>The Princess and the Goblin</i> is the story of the young Princess Irene, her good friend Curdie--a minor's son--and Irene's mysterious and beautiful great great grandmother, who lives in a secret room at the top of the castle stairs. Filled with images of dungeons and goblins, mysterious fires, burning roses, and a thread so fine as to be invisible and yet--like prayer--strong enough to lead the Princess back home to her grandmother's arms, this is a story of Curdie's slow realization that sometimes, as the princess tells him, "you must believe without seeing." Simple enough for reading aloud to a child (as I've done myself more than once with my daughter), it's rich enough to repay endless delighted readings for the adult. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>George MacDonald was a prolific writer who enjoyed enormous success with his books for both adults and children.

This utilitarian book catalogs the varieties of microscopic life in ponds and streams and offers instructions on collecting and studying samples. An introduction to the five kingdoms and microscopic life in general is followed by descriptions of Monera, Protista, and a variety of microscopic animals. Similar species are grouped together, but the text is weak on pointing out similarities and making comparisons that would help readers keep the data sorted out. There are also sensationalized statements that need more clarification. For example, the author claims that, "90 percent of the average human being is made up of bacteria;" it is not clear what this figure is based on. The explanation of the sizes of these species is muddy, too. Although Loewer explains how long a micron is in comparison to an inch, some organisms are described in terms of microns and others in terms of millimeters but how many microns are in a millimeter is never made clear. The book's strength is its instructions for collecting and studying these creatures; it explains getting samples, using microscopes, and what to look for. Some of the tasks will need adult supervision, but the information could be useful to students who need ideas for biology-based science projects. Excellent drawings complement the text, providing close-up views of the life forms described. The end result is mixed, with the book's appeal limited by its somewhat dull and sometimes vague text.?Jeffrey A. French, Cleveland Heights-University Heights Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 5^-8. In a factual, scientific presentation, this book examines a drop of pond water to reveal the teeming unseen life present there, and shows how, with a microscope or hand-held lens, youngsters can explore the wonders of freshwater biology. A short introduction places these studies in the framework of the five kingdoms of living things, and simple drawings help readers comprehend the relative sizes of the microorganisms. Almost every page contains several precise drawings interpreting what the microscope reveals. The emphasis is on the role microscopic organisms play in nature. Enhanced by a glossary and bibliography, the very detailed book will serve the young researcher well. <i>Susan DeRonne</i></p><h2>The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, and Springsteen and the Head-on Collision of Rock and Comm erce</h2><p>In 1964, on the brink of the British Invasion, the music business in America shunned rock and roll. There was no rock press, no such thing as artist management -- literally no rock-and-roll business. Today the industry will gross over $20 billion. How did this change happen?<br><br>From the moment Pete Seeger tried to cut the power at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival debut of Bob Dylan's electric band, rock's cultural influence and business potential have been grasped by a rare assortment of ambitious and farsighted musicians and businessmen. Jon Landau took calls from legendary producer Jerry Wexler in his Brandeis dorm room and went on to orchestrate Bruce Springsteen's career. Albert Grossman's cold-eyed assessment of the financial power at his clients' fingertips made him the first rock manager to blaze the trail that David Geffen transformed into a superhighway. Dylan's uncanny ability to keep his manipulation of the business separate from his art and reputation prefigured the savvy -- and increasingly cynical -- professionalism of groups like the Eagles.<br><br>Fred Goodman, a longtime rock critic and journalist, digs into the contradictions and ambiguities of a generation that spurned and sought success with equal fervor. <b>The Mansion on the Hill</b>, named after a song title used by Hank Williams, Neil Young, and Bruce Springsteen, breaks new ground in our understanding of the people and forces that have shaped the music.</p><p>If you wanted to write the definitive history of rock music, you'd need three things: a deep appreciation of the music, an understanding of business, and a journalist's skills and instincts. Fred Goodman has all three, and <i>The Mansion on the Hill</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in how a counter-cultural phenomenon with moral overtones became--in a mere thirty years--a multibillion-dollar business. Goodman, a former editor at <i>Rolling Stone</i>, traces the arc of this weird transformation by focusing principally on the stories of a handful of key artists and their managers--Bob Dylan and Albert Grossman, Neil Young and David Geffen, and Bruce Springsteen and Jon Landau--but the book is richly populated with others, famous and not-so-famous. Goodman makes good use of his extensive research (he conducted 200 interviews over three years), and admirably balances reportorial analysis with a certain passion for the values that rock music once stood for--and sometimes still does.Fred Goodman is a writer specializing in the music and entertainment business. From 1987 to 1990 he was a senior editor at <b>Rolling Stone</b>, where he is now a contributing editor. He has written for <b>The New York Times</b>, <b>Vanity Fair</b>, <b>GQ</b>, <b>M</b>, and <b>The Village Voice</b>.

This tale from Korea is universal--a small child waits for Mama at the station, asking the conductor if he has seen her. The conductor hasn&#39;t, but cautions the child to wait a little farther from the tracks. It is cold and snowy but the child waits patiently until finally Mama comes. In the last wordless spread, we see the small hand in a mother&#39;s firm clasp as they walk away from us. The art and text are so authentic, so real, that this book is best published in a bilingual edition that respects and honors those traditions. The Korean setting gives it special appeal to a growing demographic segment. The institutional market is especially hungry for bilingual books in languages beyond Spanish.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;Originally published in a Korean newspaper in 1938, this slight story tells of a very young boy waiting patiently for his mother at her streetcar stop. He asks one driver after another if she is coming, standing alone in the cold as daylight dims and snow begins to fall. The last wordless spread shows a snow-covered village with the tiny, almost imperceptible figures of a woman and child walking hand-in-hand through the storm. Readers need to look carefully at this spread to find the pair; otherwise the story is baffling and tragic. The Korean text, written in Hangeul, is accompanied by the English translation, although many pages are wordless. The lovely new pastel-and-ink illustrations depict life of the period. Some are simple ink drawings on ivory pages; others fill the pages with color and texture. The contrast is very pleasing. Changes in perspective effectively create movement and involvement. The text seems secondary to the setting and the art. An afterword on various details in the pictures is included. A worthwhile addition for its multicultural interest and its striking illustrations.&#x2014;<i>Mary Hazelton, Elementary Schools in Warren &amp; Waldoboro, ME</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Unsettled by a sense of intense evil within the house, she soon becomes obsessed with the belief that malevolent forces are stalking the children in her care. Obsession of a more worldly variety lies at the heart of&nbsp;<i>The Aspern Papers</i>, the tale of a literary historian determined to get his hands on some letters written by a great poet-and prepared to use trickery and deception to achieve his aims.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The story starts conventionally enough with friends sharing ghost stories 'round the fire on Christmas Eve. One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered, <i>The Turn of Screw</i> generates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

With her distinctive cartoon-strip style, she has now illustrated and retold many literary classics for children, including Greek Myths and Mr William Shakespeare&#39;s Plays. Marcia lives in Barnes, London.Grade 3-5. Williams's version of these two Greek stories continues in the comic-strip format the reteller popularized in King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (1996), Greek Myths for Young Children (1992), and Sinbad the Sailor (1994, all Candlewick). In text that runs below each row of cartoons, Williams manages to distill a complex and multilayered saga into a logical sequence of cause and effect. From the discord created by the golden apple, through the Trojan War and the voyages of Odysseus, each major event is succinctly captured on one or two pages and bordered by an intricate frame. While brevity robs the retelling of drama and personality, these elements are provided in excess in the watercolor illustrations of various sizes. A plethora of details can be examined in each cell, which contains dialogue between gods and mortals as well as plenty of action. Noble and ignoble alike are caricatured, blood and gore flow freely, and witty and witless epithets are hurled about. There are lots of bare bottoms and everyone is depicted with peculiarly puckered lips. Although the vocabulary is challenging, the format will appeal to reluctant readers.

His Clarion titles include THE BOYS&#39; WAR and other award-winning nonfiction as well as a picture book, FERGUS AND THE NIGHT-DEMON. He lives in Maplewood, New Jersey, with his family. For more information visit www.jimmurphybooks.com.Gr. 5 and up. As he did in <i>The Boys' War</i> (1990) and <i>The Long Road to Gettysburg</i> (1992), Murphy draws on memoirs and letters to humanize history. This time his main source is the journal of the great writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who traveled in 1879 from Scotland to the woman he loved in California, first on a crowded boat and then on a series of crammed, painfully uncomfortable trains on the transcontinental railroad. Murphy weaves together Stevenson's perilous journey with a general history of the railroad--how it was planned and built, who built it, what it was like to ride it if you were rich and if you were poor, and how it changed the country and those who lived there. Murphy's style is plain: facts and feelings tell a compelling story of adventure and failure, courage and cruelty, enrichment and oppression. The handsome book's design includes lots of white space, two endpaper maps, and many prints, drawings, and black-and-white photographs, carefully captioned to make you pore over the details. The direct quotations from Stevenson show him as observer and participant. This was before he became famous, and he identifies with the emigrants' painful struggle as well as their hope. He's excited by the diversity in America (he loves the place names that express how "all times, races, and languages have brought their contribution"); at the same time, he's appalled at the treatment of Native Americans ("I was ashamed for the thing we call civilization"). Murphy provides no direct documentation (often the source is "one passenger recalled," "some historians have speculated"), but the very long bibliography will be a starting point for those stimulated to read further. The experience of ordinary people revitalizes the myths of the West. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>National Geographic Guide to the Lewis &amp; Clark Trail</h2><p>Richly illustrated with full-color photographs and maps, an updated and expanded edition of the distinctive travel guide retraces the historic route taken by Lewis and Clark on their early nineteenth-century expedition and notes points of interest and historical significance along the way.

It doesn't correlate with IQ, and most psychologists failed to spot it because it is found in such a disparate, rag-tag group of people - American weather-forecasters, professional gamblers, and hedge-fund managers, for example.<br>This book shows just how important risk intelligence is. Many people in positions which require high risk intelligence - doctors, financial regulators and bankers, for instance - seem unable to navigate what Evans calls the "darkened room", the domain of doubt and uncertainty.&nbsp;<i>Risk Intelligence</i> is a traveller's guide to the twilight zone of probabilities and speculation. Evans shows us how risk intelligence is vital to making good decisions, from dealing with climate change to combating terrorism. He argues that we can all learn a lot from expert gamblers, not just about money, but about how to make decisions in all aspects of our lives. Introducing a wealth of fascinating research findings and using a wide range of real-life examples--from the brilliant risk assessment skills of horse race handicappers to the tragically flawed evaluations of risk that caused the financial crisis--Evans reveals the common errors in our thinking that undermine our risk intelligence. He also introduces a host of simple techniques we can use to boost our RQ, and a brief test to measure our RQ. Both highly engaging and truly mind-changing, <i>Risk Intelligence</i> will fascinate all of those who are interested in how we can improve our thinking in order to enhance our lives.</p><p>Dylan Evans is the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Projection Point, which designs risk intelligence training programs for corporate clients.&nbsp; He has written several popular science books, including&nbsp;<i>Emotion: The Science of Sentiment</i>&nbsp;(Oxford University Press, 2001) and&nbsp;<i>Placebo: The Belief Effect</i>&nbsp;(HarperCollins, 2003), and in 2001 he was voted one of the twenty best young writers in Britain by the&nbsp;<i>Independent on Sunday</i>. He received a PhD in Philosophy from the London School of Economics in 2000, and has held academic appointments at King's College London, the University of Bath, the University of the West of England, and University College Cork.

While her colleagues seem to see them everywhere, she is more circumspect. When she&#x2019;s interviewing a suspect, she doesn&#x2019;t jump to conclusions. Instead she patiently looks for the telltale signs that suggest dishonesty. Even so, she is rarely 100 percent sure that she&#x2019;s spotted a lie; it&#x2019;s more often a question of tilting the scales one way or another, she says.<br> <br>Jamie is viewed as a bit of an oddball at the investment bank where he works. When everyone else is sure that prices will continue to go up, Jamie is often more skeptical. On the other hand, there are times when everyone else is pessimistic but Jamie is feeling quite bullish. Jamie and his colleagues are not always at odds, but when they disagree it tends to be Jamie who is right.<br> <br>Diane is overjoyed about her new relationship. When she phones her best friend, Evelyn, to tell her all about the new man in her life, Evelyn urges caution. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the chance that you&#x2019;ll still be with this guy in twelve months?&#x201d; she asks, as she has done before. Diane&#x2019;s reply is just as predictable. &#x201c;Oh, ninety, maybe ninety-five percent,&#x201d; she replies, as she always does. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Danny is the one!&#x201d; Two months later, she&#x2019;s broken up again.<br> <br>Jeff has just been promoted to the rank of captain in the US Army. Since he is new to the role, he often feels unsure of his decisions and seeks out his colonel for a second opinion. The colonel is beginning to get rather tired of Jeff&#x2019;s pestering him, and has taken to playing a little game. Whenever Jeff asks his opinion, he responds by asking how confident Jeff is of his own hunch. Usually Jeff replies that he&#x2019;s only about 40 or 50 percent sure. But nine times of out ten, the colonel agrees with Jeff&#x2019;s opinion.<br> <br>These four people display different degrees of risk intelligence. Kathryn and Jamie have high risk intelligence, while Diane and Jeff are at the other end of the spectrum. What exactly do I mean by risk intelligence? Most simply put, it is the ability to estimate probabilities accurately, whether the probabilities of various events occurring in our lives, such as a car accident, or the likelihood that some piece of information we&#x2019;ve just come across is actually true, such as a rumor about a takeover bid. Or perhaps we have to judge whether a defendant in a murder trial is guilty, or must decide whether it&#x2019;s safe to take a trip to a country that&#x2019;s been put on a watch list. We often have to make educated guesses about such things, but fifty years of research in the psychology of judgment and decision making show that most people are not very good at doing so. Many people, for example, tend to overestimate their chances of winning the lottery, while they underestimate the probability that they will get divorced.<br> <br>At the heart of risk intelligence lies the ability to gauge the limits of your own knowledge&#x2014;to be cautious when you don&#x2019;t know much, and to be confident when, by contrast, you know a lot. People with high risk intelligence tend to be on the button in doing this. Kathryn and Jamie, for example, are relatively risk intelligent because they know pretty well how much they know and have just the right level of confidence in their judgments. Diane and Jeff are much less proficient, though in different ways; while Diane is overconfident, Jeff is underconfident.<br> <br>This is a book about why so many of us are so bad at estimating probabilities and how we can become better at it. This is a vital skill to develop, as our ability to cope with uncertainty is one of the most important requirements for success in life, yet also one of the most neglected. We may not appreciate just how often we&#x2019;re required to exercise it, and how much impact our ability to do so can have on our lives, and even on the whole of society. Consider these examples, from the relatively mundane to the life-threatening:<br><br> You are buying a new 42-inch HDTV, and a sales assistant asks if you would also like to purchase an extended warranty. He explains that if anything goes wrong with your TV in the next three years, the warranty will entitle you to swap it for a brand-new one, no questions asked. When deciding whether or not to purchase the extended warranty, you should consider the price of the TV, the price of the warranty, and the probability that the TV will indeed go wrong in the next three years. But what&#x2019;s the chance that this will actually happen? Here&#x2019;s where your risk intelligence comes in.<br> <br> A bank manager is explaining to you the various options available for investing a windfall that has just come your way. Riskier investment funds pay more interest, but there&#x2019;s also a higher chance of making a loss. How much of your money should you allocate to the high-risk funds and how much to the low-risk ones? It&#x2019;s partly a question of risk appetite, but you also need to know more about <i>how much</i> riskier the high-risk funds are. Are they 2 percent or 10 percent riskier? You need, in other words, to put a number on it.<br> <br> Doctors have discovered a tumor in your breast. Luckily, it is not malignant. It will not spread to the rest of your body, and there is no need to remove your breast. But there is a chance that it may recur and become malignant at some time in the future, and it might then spread quickly. In order to prevent this possibility, the doctor suggests that you do, after all, consider having your breast removed. It&#x2019;s a terrible dilemma; clearly you don&#x2019;t want the cancer to recur, but it seems a tragedy to remove a healthy breast. How high would the chance of recurrence have to be before you decided to have the breast removed?<br><br>When making evaluations in situations of uncertainty, people often make very poor probability estimates and may even ignore probabilities altogether, with sometimes devastating consequences. The decisions that we face, both individually and as a society, are only becoming more daunting. The following cases further illustrate how important it is that we learn to develop our risk intelligence.<br> <br><b>THE CSI EFFECT</b><br> <br>The television drama <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i> is hugely popular. In 2002, it was the most watched show on American television, and by 2009 the worldwide audience was estimated to be more than 73 million. It isn&#x2019;t, however, such a hit with police officers and district attorneys, who have criticized the series for presenting a highly misleading image of how crimes are solved. Their fears have been echoed by Monica Robbers, a criminologist, who found evidence that jurors have increasingly unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence. Bernard Knight, formerly one of Britain&#x2019;s chief pathologists, agrees. Jurors today, he observes, expect more categorical proof than forensic science is capable of delivering. And he attributes this trend directly to the influence of television crime dramas.<br> <br>Science rarely proves anything conclusively. Rather, it gradually accumulates evidence that makes it more or less likely that a hypothesis is true. Yet in <i>CSI</i> and other shows like it, the evidence is often portrayed as decisive. When those who have watched such shows then serve on juries, the evidence in real-life court cases can appear rather disappointing by contrast. Even when high-quality DNA evidence is available, the expert witnesses who present such evidence in court point out that they are still dealing only in probabilities. When the jurors contrast this with the certainties of television, where a match between a trace of DNA found at a crime scene and that of the suspect may be unequivocal, they can be less willing to convict than in the past.<br> <br>The phenomenon has even been given a name: &#x201c;the <i>CSI</i> effect.&#x201d; In 2010, a study published in <i>Forensic Science International</i> found that prosecutors now have to spend time explaining to juries that investigators often fail to find evidence at a crime scene and hence that its absence in court is not conclusive proof of the defendant&#x2019;s innocence. They have even introduced a new kind of witness to make this point&#x2014;a so-called negative evidence witness.<br> <br>Unrealistic expectations about the strength of forensic evidence did not begin with <i>CSI,</i> of course. Fingerprints led to the same problem; they have been treated by the courts as conclusive evidence for a hundred years. In 1892, Charles Darwin&#x2019;s cousin Francis Galton calculated that the chance of two different individuals having the same fingerprints was about 1 in 64 billion, and fingerprint evidence has been treated as virtually infallible ever since, which means that a single incriminating fingerprint can still send someone to jail. But, like DNA evidence, even the best fingerprints are imperfect. After a mark is found at a crime scene, it must be compared to a reference fingerprint, or &#x201c;exemplar,&#x201d; retrieved from police files or taken from a suspect. But no reproduction is perfect; small variations creep in when a finger is inked or scanned to create an exemplar.<br> <br>More important, fingerprint analysis is a fundamentally subjective process; when identifying distorted prints, examiners must choose which features to highlight, and even highly trained experts can be swayed by outside information. Yet the subjective nature of this process is rarely highlighted during court cases and is badly understood by most jurors. Christophe Champod, an expert in forensic identification at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, thinks the language of certainty that examiners are forced to use hides the element of subjective judgment from the court. He proposes that fingerprint evidence be presented in probabilistic terms and that examiners should be free to talk about probable or possible matches. In a criminal case, for example, an examiner could testify that there was a 95 percent chance of a match if the defender left the mark but a one-in-a-billion chance of a match if someone else left it. &#x201c;Once certainty is quantified,&#x201d; says Champod, &#x201c;it becomes transparent.&#x201d; Certainty may not seem like the kind of thing that <i>can</i> be quantified, but this is exactly what numerical probabilities are designed to do. By expressing chance in terms of numbers&#x2014;by saying, for example, that there is a 95 percent chance that a fingerprint was left by a particular suspect&#x2014;the strength of the evidence becomes much clearer and easier to comprehend. Even with a probability of 95 percent it is clear that there is still a one-in-twenty chance that the mark came from someone else.<br> <br>The tendency to consider fingerprint evidence as more conclusive than it is can have tragic consequences. Take the case of Shirley McKie, a successful Scottish policewoman who was accused of leaving her fingerprint at a crime scene and lying about it. In 1997, McKie was part of a police team investigating the vicious murder of Marion Ross in Kilmarnock, Scotland. After the thumbprint of a local builder was found on a gift tag in the victim&#x2019;s home, he was accused of the murder. When the murdered woman&#x2019;s fingerprints were found on a cookie tin stuffed with banknotes, which McKie discovered when searching the builder&#x2019;s bedroom, it looked like an open-and-shut case. At the time, fingerprints were the gold standard of forensic evidence, and even a single print was sufficient to secure a conviction. Moreover, in the ninety-two years since Scotland Yard had first used them to prove a murderer&#x2019;s guilt, their veracity had never been successfully challenged in a Scottish court.<br> <br>Then the forensic team discovered something else. They identified a thumbprint on the bathroom door frame at the victim&#x2019;s house as belonging to Shirley McKie. This was a serious matter, as McKie had never been granted permission to enter the dead woman&#x2019;s bungalow, which had been sealed off. If she was thought to have crossed the cordon and contaminated vital forensic evidence, she would face disciplinary action. But McKie knew she had never set foot inside the crime scene, so the match between her print and the mark on the bathroom door frame could only be a mistake. Could it have been mislabeled by the fingerprint experts?<br> <br>The Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) refused even to contemplate the possibility. Not only would it undermine its case against the builder they suspected of murdering Marion Ross, but it might also wreck the Lockerbie trial&#x2014;conducted in The Hague under Scottish jurisdiction&#x2014;of two Libyans accused of blowing up a Boeing 747 while en route from London to New York in December 1988. The case against one of the Libyan suspects involved a contentious fingerprint found on a travel document, and several senior figures involved in the Lockerbie trial were also involved in the Marion Ross investigation. If the work of those experts was revealed to be so seriously flawed that they could not even accurately match a blameless policewoman&#x2019;s prints, both cases could fall flat. According to Pan Am&#x2019;s senior Lockerbie investigator, the FBI was so concerned that the case against the two Libyans might be undermined by the McKie debacle that they put pressure on the Scottish team to interfere with the evidence against her.<br> <br>Since McKie had stated at the murder trial that she had never been in the victim&#x2019;s house, she was charged with perjury. Arrested in an early-morning raid, she was taken to the local police station (where her father had been a commanding officer), marched past colleagues and friends, strip-searched, and thrown in a cell. Luckily, two US fingerprint experts came to McKie&#x2019;s rescue. Pat Wertheim and David Grieve spent hours comparing the fingerprint on the door frame with an imprint of McKie&#x2019;s left thumb and concluded that they belonged to different people. Moreover, they became convinced that the misidentification of the two marks could not have been an honest mistake. &#x201c;Shirley&#x2019;s thumbprint appears to have been smudged to mask the differences with the mark on the frame,&#x201d; Wertheim noted. That clinched it; the jury acquitted McKie of perjury in May 1999, saving her from a possible eight-year jail sentence. Effectively they saved her life, since McKie later admitted that she could not have faced prison knowing she was innocent.<br> <br>As she left the court, McKie thought she would receive a formal apology and be invited to return to the job she loved. Instead, she was deemed medically unfit for service and forced into a long legal battle with the police. Although she was eventually awarded �750,000 in compensation, the SCRO never admitted it was wrong, and nobody ever offered her an apology.<br> <br><b>HOMELAND SECURITY</b><br> <br>Of the many new security measures introduced in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, few have caused more irritation than those implemented at airports.<br> <br>Two days after the attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) promulgated new rules prohibiting any type of knife in secured airport areas and on airplanes. The hijackers had been able to carry box cutters through security because at the time any knife with a blade up to four inches long was permitted on US domestic flights. In November 2001, all airport screening in the United States was transferred from private companies to the newly created Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Since then, every new terrorist plot adds further checks to the gauntlet that passengers must run.<br> <br>After the &#x201c;shoe bomber&#x201d; Richard Reid failed in his attempt to blow up a commercial aircraft in flight, all airline passengers departing from an airport in the United States were made to walk through airport security in socks or bare feet while their shoes were scanned for bombs.

It&#39;s the perfect guide to Paris and its wonderful celebration of food.</p><p>Ina Garten's much loved cookbooks, <i>The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook</i>, <i>Barefoot Contessa Parties!</i>, and <i>Barefoot Contessa Family Style</i>, offer relaxed yet stylish dishes that don't tax the cook. Her food works wonderfully for entertaining but shouldn't be limited to such times. <i>Barefoot in Paris</i> finds Garten (almost inevitably) in France, "translating" native dishes for the American home cook. The result is rewarding, and should get those reluctant to "cook French" to do just that. Covered are classics like Celery Root R�moulade, Boeuf Bourguignon, and Chicken with Forty Cloves of Garlic, but also "newer" dishes like Zucchini Vichyssoise and Avocado and Grapefruit Salad. If Garten ranges wide from typical Parisian fare--in, for example, recipes like Rosemary Cashews, Tomato Rice Pilaf, and a distinctly American Brownie Tart--these nonetheless embody the French approach. Her sweets, including the likes of Peaches in Sauternes, Plum Cake "Tatin," and an exemplary Cr�me Br�l�e, are particularly tempting. Included also are asides like "About French Table Settings," and "If You're Going," a resource guide, that, practicality apart, give readers a sense of French culinary life. With color photos, this is winning addition to the Barefoot collection. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>Hearty boeuf Bourguignon served in deep bowls over a garlic-rubbed slice of baguette toast; decadently rich croque monsieur, eggy and oozing with cheese; gossamer creme brulee, its sweetness offset by a brittle burnt-sugar topping. Whether shared in a cozy French bistro or in your own home, the romance and enduring appeal of French country cooking is irrefutable. Here is the book that helps you bring that spirit, those evocative dishes, into your own home. <br>What Ina Garten is known for--on her Food Network show and in her three previous bestselling books--is adding a special twist to familiar dishes, while also streamlining the recipes so you spend less time in the kitchen but still emerge with perfection. And that's exactly what she offers in "Barefoot in Paris. Ina's kir royale includes the unique addition of raspberry liqueur--a refreshing alternative to the traditional creme de cassis. Her vichyssoise is brightened with the addition of zucchini, and her chocolate mousse is deeply flavored with the essence of orange. All of these dishes are true to their Parisian roots, but all offer something special--and are thoroughly delicious, completely accessible, and the perfect fare for friends and family. <br>"Barefoot in Paris is suffused with Ina's love of the city, of the bustling outdoor markets and alluring little shops, of the bakeries and fromageries and charcuteries--of the wonderful celebration of food that you find on every street corner, in every neighborhood.

Peering through a tiny crack in the curtains, I could see the words REGISTERED and INSURED stamped on it in big red letters. For the first time I thought he seemed furtive and nervous, actually looking around at his exterior surroundings instead of at the spooky furniture deep in his head. I knew what was in the package: a 6.5mm Carcano rifle&#x2014;also known as a Mannlicher-Carcano&#x2014;complete with scope, purchased from Klein&#x2019;s Sporting Goods in Chicago. Five minutes after he climbed the outside stairs to the second floor, the gun Lee would use to change history was in a closet above my head. Marina took the famous pictures of him holding it just outside my living room window six days later, but I didn&#x2019;t see it. That was a Sunday, and I was in Jodie. As the tenth grew closer, those weekends with Sadie had become the most important, the <i>dearest,</i> things in my life. <br><br>9 <br><br>I came awake with a jerk, hearing someone mutter &#x201c;Still not too late&#x201d; under his breath. I realized it was me and shut up. <br><br>Sadie murmured some thick protest and turned over in bed. The familiar squeak of the springs locked me in place and time: the Candlewood Bungalows, April 5, 1963. I fumbled my watch from the nightstand and peered at the luminous numbers. It was quarter past two in the morning, which meant it was actually the sixth of April. <br><br><i>Still not too late.</i> <br><br>Not too late for what? To back off, to let well enough alone? Or bad enough, come to that? The idea of backing off was attractive, God knew. If I went ahead and things went wrong, this could be my last night with Sadie. Ever. <br><br><i>Even if you do have to kill him, you don&#x2019;t have to do it right away.</i> <br><br>True enough. Oswald was going to relocate to New Orleans for awhile after the attempt on the general&#x2019;s life&#x2014;another shitty apartment, one I&#x2019;d already visited&#x2014;but not for two weeks. That would give me plenty of time to stop his clock. But I sensed it would be a mistake to wait very long. I might find reasons to keep on waiting. The best one was beside me in this bed: long, lovely, and smoothly naked. Maybe she was just another trap laid by the obdurate past, but that didn&#x2019;t matter, because I loved her. And I could envision a scenario&#x2014;all too clearly&#x2014;where I&#x2019;d have to run after killing Oswald. Run where? Back to Maine, of course. Hoping I could stay ahead of the cops just long enough to get to the rabbit-hole and escape into a future where Sadie Dunhill would be . . . well . . . about eighty years old. If she were alive at all. Given her cigarette habit, that would be like rolling six the hard way. <br><br>I got up and went to the window. Only a few of the bungalows were occupied on this early-spring weekend. There was a mud- or manure-splattered pickup truck with a trailer full of what looked like farm implements behind it. An Indian motorcycle with a sidecar. A couple of station wagons. And a two-tone Plymouth Fury. The moon was sliding in and out of thin clouds and it wasn&#x2019;t possible to make out the color of the car&#x2019;s lower half by that stuttery light, but I was pretty sure I knew what it was, anyway. <br><br>I pulled on my pants, undershirt, and shoes. Then I slipped out of the cabin and walked across the courtyard. The chilly air bit at my bed-warm skin, but I barely felt it. Yes, the car was a Fury, and yes, it was white over red, but this one wasn&#x2019;t from Maine <i>or</i> Arkansas; the plate was Oklahoma, and the decal in the rear window read GO, SOONERS. I peeked in and saw a scatter of textbooks. Some student, maybe headed south to visit his folks on spring break. Or a couple of horny teachers taking advantage of the Candlewood&#x2019;s liberal guest policy. <br><br>Just another not-quite-on-key chime as the past harmonized with itself. I touched the trunk, as I had back in Lisbon Falls, then returned to the bungalow. Sadie had pushed the sheet down to her waist, and when I came in, the draft of cool air woke her up. She sat, holding the sheet over her breasts, then let it drop when she saw it was me. <br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t sleep, honey?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I had a bad dream and went out for some air.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What was it?&#x201d; <br><br>I unbuttoned my jeans, kicked off my loafers. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Try. My mother always used to say if you tell your dreams, they won&#x2019;t come true.&#x201d; <br><br>I got into bed with her wearing nothing but my undershirt. &#x201c;<i>My</i> mother used to say if you kiss your honey, they won&#x2019;t come true.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Did she actually say that?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said thoughtfully, &#x201c;it sounds possible. Let&#x2019;s try it.&#x201d; <br><br>We tried it. <br><br>One thing led to another. <br><br>10 <br><br>Afterward, she lit a cigarette. I lay watching the smoke drift up and turn blue in the occasional moonlight coming through the half-drawn curtains. <i>I&#x2019;d never leave the curtains that way at Neely Street,</i> I thought. <i>At Neely Street, in my other life, I&#x2019;m always alone but still careful to close them all the way. Except when I&#x2019;m peeking, that is. Lurking.</i> <br><br>Just then I didn&#x2019;t like myself very much. <br><br>&#x201c;George?&#x201d; <br><br>I sighed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not my name.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br><br>I looked at her. She inhaled deeply, enjoying her cigarette guiltlessly, as people do in the Land of Ago. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any inside information, if that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re thinking. But it stands to reason. The rest of your past is made up, after all. And I&#x2019;m glad. I don&#x2019;t like George all that much. It&#x2019;s kind of . . . what&#x2019;s that word you use sometimes? . . . kind of dorky.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;How does Jake suit you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;As in Jacob?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I like it.&#x201d; She turned to me. &#x201c;In the Bible, Jacob wrestled an angel. And you&#x2019;re wrestling, too. Aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I suppose I am, but not with an angel.&#x201d; Although Lee Oswald didn&#x2019;t make much of a devil, either. I liked George de Mohren--schildt better for the devil role. In the Bible, Satan&#x2019;s a tempter who makes the offer and then stands aside. I hoped de Mohrenschildt was like that. <br><br>Sadie snubbed her cigarette. Her voice was calm, but her eyes were dark. &#x201c;Are you going to be hurt?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Are you going away? Because if you have to go away, I&#x2019;m not sure I can stand it. I would have died before I said it when I was there, but Reno was a nightmare. Losing you for good . . .&#x201d; She shook her head slowly. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not sure I could stand that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I want to marry you,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; she said softly. &#x201c;Just when I&#x2019;m ready to say it&#x2019;ll never happen, Jake-alias-George says right now.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not right now, but if the next week goes the way I hope it does . . . will you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Of course. But I <i>do</i> have to ask one teensy question.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Am I single? Legally single? Is that what you want to know?&#x201d; <br><br>She nodded. <br><br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>She let out a comic sigh and grinned like a kid. Then she sobered. &#x201c;Can I help you? Let me help you.&#x201d; <br><br>The thought turned me cold, and she must have seen it. Her lower lip crept into her mouth. She bit down on it with her teeth. &#x201c;That bad, then,&#x201d; she said musingly. <br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s put it this way: I&#x2019;m currently close to a big machine full of sharp teeth, and it&#x2019;s running full speed. I won&#x2019;t allow you next to me while I&#x2019;m monkeying with it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;When is it?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Your . . . I don&#x2019;t know . . . your date with destiny?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Still to be determined.&#x201d; I had a feeling that I&#x2019;d said too much already, but since I&#x2019;d come this far, I decided to go a little farther. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s going to happen this Wednesday night.

At the same time, we&#x2019;re expected to make more&#x2014;and faster&#x2014;decisions about our lives than ever before. No wonder, then, that the average person reports frequently losing car keys or reading glasses, missing appointments, and feeling worn out by the effort required just to keep up. <p>But somehow some people become quite accomplished at managing information&nbsp;flow. In The Organized Mind, Daniel J. Levitin, Ph.D., uses the latest brain science&nbsp;to demonstrate how those people excel&#x2014;and how readers can use these methods&nbsp;to regain a sense of mastery over the way they organize their homes, workplaces,&nbsp;and lives.</p> <p></p> <p>With lively, entertaining chapters on everything from the kitchen junk drawer to&nbsp;health care to gambling in Las Vegas, Levitin reveals how new research into the&nbsp;cognitive neuroscience of attention and memory can be applied to daily life.

Although his regime collapsed when she was eleven, she remembered well the long lines for food, the shortages, and the economic destitution that lasted far beyond his overthrow. Ioana was bright and curious, and although still young, she had the colors of a true scholar: When she encountered a new scientific idea or problem, she would look at it from every angle, reading everything she could get her hands on. I met her during her first semester at university, newly arrived in North America, when she took my introductory course on the psychology of thinking and reasoning. Although the class had seven hundred students, she distinguished herself early on by thoughtfully answering questions posed in class, peppering me with questions during office hours, and constantly proposing new experiments.</p><p><br>I ran into her one day at the college bookstore, frozen in the aisle with all the pens and pencils. She was leaning limply against the shelf, clearly distraught.<br><br>&#x201c;Is everything all right?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;It can be really terrible living in America,&#x201d; Ioana said.<br><br>&#x201c;Compared to Soviet Romania?!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everything is so complicated. I looked for a student apartment. Rent or lease? Furnished or unfurnished? Top floor or ground floor? Carpet or hardwood floor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you make a decision?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, finally. But it&#x2019;s impossible to know which is best. Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; her voice trailed off.<br><br>&#x201c;Is there a problem with the apartment?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, the apartment is fine. But today is my fourth time in the bookstore. Look! An entire&nbsp;<i>row</i>&nbsp;full of pens. In Romania, we had three kinds of pens. And many times there was a shortage&#x2014;no pens at all. In America, there are more than fifty different kinds. Which one do I need for my biology class? Which one for poetry? Do I want felt tip, ink, gel, cartridge, erasable? Ballpoint, razor point, roller ball? One hour I am here reading labels.&#x201d;<br><br>Every day, we are confronted with dozens of decisions, most of which we would characterize as insignificant or unimportant&#x2014;whether to put on our left sock first or our right, whether to take the bus or the subway to work, what to eat, where to shop. We get a taste of Ioana&#x2019;s disorientation when we travel, not only to other countries but even to other states. The stores are different, the products are different. Most of us have adopted a strategy to get along called&nbsp;<i>satisficing,</i>&nbsp;a term coined by the Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon, one of the founders of the fields of organization theory and information processing. Simon wanted a word to describe not getting the very best option but one that was good enough. For things that don&#x2019;t matter critically, we make a choice that satisfies us and is deemed sufficient. You don&#x2019;t really know if your dry cleaner is&nbsp;<i>the best</i>&#x2014;you only know that they&#x2019;re good enough. And that&#x2019;s what helps you get by. You don&#x2019;t have time to sample all the dry cleaners within a twenty-four-block radius of your home. Does Dean &amp; DeLuca really have the best gourmet takeout? It doesn&#x2019;t matter&#x2014;it&#x2019;s good enough. Satisficing is one of the foundations of productive human behavior; it prevails when we don&#x2019;t waste time on decisions that don&#x2019;t matter, or more accurately, when we don&#x2019;t waste time trying to find improvements that are not going to make a significant difference in our happiness or satisfaction.<br><br>All of us engage in satisficing every time we clean our homes. If we got down on the floor with a toothbrush every day to clean the grout, if we scrubbed the windows and walls every single day, the house would be spotless. But few of us go to this much trouble even on a weekly basis (and when we do, we&#x2019;re likely to be labeled obsessive-compulsive). For most of us, we clean our houses until they are clean enough, reaching a kind of equilibrium between effort and benefit. It is this cost-benefits analysis that is at the heart of satisficing (Simon was also a respected economist).<br><br>Recent research in social psychology has shown that happy people are not people who have more; rather, they are people who are happy with what they already have. Happy people engage in satisficing&nbsp;<i>all of the time</i>, even if they don&#x2019;t know it. Warren Buffett can be seen as embracing satisficing to an extreme&#x2014;one of the richest men in the world, he lives in Omaha, a block from the highway, in the same modest home he has lived in for fifty years. He once told a radio interviewer that for breakfasts during his weeklong visit to New York City, he&#x2019;d bought himself a gallon of milk and a box of Oreo cookies. But Buffett does not satisfice with his investment strategies; satisficing is a tool for not wasting time on things that are not your highest priority. For your high-priority endeavors, the old-fashioned pursuit of excellence remains the right strategy. Do you want your surgeon or your airplane mechanic or the director of a $100 million feature film to do&nbsp;<i>just good enough</i>&nbsp;or do the best they possibly can? Sometimes you want more than Oreos and milk.<br><br>Part of my Romanian student&#x2019;s despondency could be chalked up to culture shock&#x2014;to the loss of the familiar, and immersion in the unfamiliar. But she&#x2019;s not alone. The past generation has seen an explosion of choices facing consumers. In 1976, the average supermarket stocked 9,000 unique products; today that number has ballooned to 40,000 of them, yet the average person gets 80%&#x2013;85% of their needs in only 150 different supermarket items. That means that we need to ignore 39,850 items in the store. And that&#x2019;s just supermarkets&#x2014;it&#x2019;s been estimated that there are over one million products in the United States today (based on SKUs, or&nbsp;<i>stock-keeping units</i>, those little bar codes on things we buy).<br><br>All this ignoring and deciding comes with a cost. Neuroscientists have discovered that unproductivity and loss of drive can result from&nbsp;<i>decision overload.</i>&nbsp;Although most of us have no trouble ranking the importance of decisions if asked to do so, our brains don&#x2019;t automatically do this. Ioana knew that keeping up with her coursework was more important than what pen to buy, but the mere situation of facing so many trivial decisions in daily life created neural fatigue, leaving no energy for the important decisions. Recent research shows that people who were asked to make a series of meaningless decisions of just this type&#x2014;for example, whether to write with a ballpoint pen or a felt-tip pen&#x2014;showed poorer impulse control and lack of judgment about subsequent decisions. It&#x2019;s as though our brains are configured to make a certain number of decisions per day and once we reach that limit, we can&#x2019;t make any more, regardless of how important they are. One of the most useful findings in recent neuroscience could be summed up as:&nbsp;<i>The decision-making network in our brain doesn&#x2019;t prioritize.<br></i><br>Today, we are confronted with an unprecedented amount of information, and each of us generates more information than ever before in human history. As former Boeing scientist and&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;writer Dennis Overbye notes, this information stream contains &#x201c;more and more information about our lives&#x2014;where we shop and what we buy, indeed, where we are right now&#x2014;the economy, the genomes of countless organisms we can&#x2019;t even name yet, galaxies full of stars we haven&#x2019;t counted, traffic jams in Singapore and the weather on Mars.&#x201d; That information &#x201c;tumbles faster and faster through bigger and bigger computers down to everybody&#x2019;s fingertips, which are holding devices with more processing power than the Apollo mission control.&#x201d; Information scientists have quantified all this: In 2011, Americans took in five times as much information every day as they did in 1986&#x2014;the equivalent of 175 newspapers. During our leisure time, not counting work, each of us processes 34 gigabytes or 100,000 words every day<i>.</i>&nbsp;The world&#x2019;s 21,274 television stations produce 85,000 hours of original programming every day as we watch an average of 5 hours of television each day, the equivalent of 20 gigabytes of audio-video images. That&#x2019;s not counting YouTube, which uploads 6,000 hours of video every hour. And computer gaming? It consumes more bytes than all other media put together, including DVDs, TV, books, magazines, and the Internet.<br><br>Just trying to keep our own media and electronic files organized can be overwhelming. Each of us has the equivalent of over half a million books stored on our computers, not to mention all the information stored in our cell phones or in the magnetic stripe on the back of our credit cards. We have created a world with 300 exabytes (300,000,000,000,000,000,000 pieces) of human-made information. If each of those pieces of information were written on a 3 x 5 index card and then spread out side by side, just one person&#x2019;s share&#x2014;<i>your&nbsp;</i>share of this information&#x2014;would cover every square inch of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined.<br><br>Our brains do have the ability to process the information we take in, but at a cost: We can have trouble separating the trivial from the important, and all this information processing makes us tired. Neurons are living cells with a metabolism; they need oxygen and glucose to survive and when they&#x2019;ve been working hard, we experience fatigue. Every status update you read on Facebook, every tweet or text message you get from a friend, is competing for resources in your brain with important things like whether to put your savings in stocks or bonds, where you left your passport, or how best to reconcile with a close friend you just had an argument with.<br><br>The processing capacity of the conscious mind has been estimated at 120 bits per second. That bandwidth, or window, is the speed limit for the traffic of information we can pay conscious attention to at any one time. While a great deal occurs below the threshold of our awareness, and this has an impact on how we feel and what our life is going to be like, in order for something to become encoded as part of your experience, you need to have paid conscious attention to it.<br><br>What does this bandwidth restriction&#x2014;this information speed limit&#x2014;mean in terms of our interactions with others? In order to understand one person speaking to us, we need to process 60 bits of information per second. With a processing limit of 120 bits per second, this means you can barely understand two people talking to you at the same time. Under most circumstances, you will not be able to understand three people talking at the same time. We&#x2019;re surrounded on this planet by billions of other humans, but we can understand only two at a time at the most! It&#x2019;s no wonder that the world is filled with so much misunderstanding.<br><br>With such attentional restrictions, it&#x2019;s clear why many of us feel overwhelmed by managing some of the most basic aspects of life. Part of the reason is that our brains evolved to help us deal with life during the hunter-gatherer phase of human history, a time when we might encounter no more than a thousand people across the entire span of our lifetime. Walking around midtown Manhattan, you&#x2019;ll pass that number of people in half an hour.<br><br>Attention is the most essential mental resource for any organism. It determines which aspects of the environment we deal with, and most of the time, various automatic, subconscious processes make the correct choice about what gets passed through to our conscious awareness. For this to happen, millions of neurons are constantly monitoring the environment to select the most important things for us to focus on. These neurons are collectively the&nbsp;<i>attentional filter</i>. They work largely in the background, outside of our conscious awareness. This is why most of the perceptual detritus of our daily lives doesn&#x2019;t register, or why, when you&#x2019;ve been driving on the freeway for several hours at a stretch, you don&#x2019;t remember much of the scenery that has whizzed by: Your attentional system &#x201c;protects&#x201d; you from registering it because it isn&#x2019;t deemed important. This unconscious filter follows certain principles about what it will let through to your conscious awareness.<br><br>The attentional filter is one of evolution&#x2019;s greatest achievements. In nonhumans, it ensures that they don&#x2019;t get distracted by irrelevancies. Squirrels are interested in nuts and predators, and not much else. Dogs, whose olfactory sense is one million times more sensitive than ours, use smell to gather information about the world more than they use sound, and their attentional filter has evolved to make that so. If you&#x2019;ve ever tried to call your dog while he is smelling something interesting, you know that it is very difficult to grab his attention with sound&#x2014;smell trumps sound in the dog brain. No one has yet worked out all of the hierarchies and trumping factors in the human attentional filter, but we&#x2019;ve learned a great deal about it. When our protohuman ancestors left the cover of the trees to seek new sources of food, they simultaneously opened up a vast range of new possibilities for nourishment and exposed themselves to a wide range of new predators. Being alert and vigilant to threatening sounds and visual cues is what allowed them to survive; this meant allowing an increasing amount of information through the attentional filter.<br><br>Humans are, by most biological measures, the most successful species our planet has seen. We have managed to survive in nearly every climate our planet has offered (so far), and the rate of our population expansion exceeds that of any other known organism. Ten thousand years ago, humans plus their pets and livestock accounted for about 0.1% of the terrestrial vertebrate biomass inhabiting the earth; we now account for 98%. Our success owes in large part to our cognitive capacity, the ability of our brains to flexibly handle information. But our brains evolved in a much simpler world with far less information coming at us. Today, our attentional filters easily become overwhelmed. Successful people&#x2014;or people who can afford it&#x2014;employ layers of people whose job it is to&nbsp;<i>narrow the attentional filter</i>. That is, corporate heads, political leaders, spoiled movie stars, and others whose time and attention are especially valuable have a staff of people around them who are effectively extensions of their own brains, replicating and refining the functions of the prefrontal cortex&#x2019;s attentional filter.<br><br>These highly successful persons&#x2014;let&#x2019;s call them HSPs&#x2014;have many of the daily distractions of life handled for them, allowing them to devote all of their attention to whatever is immediately before them. They seem to live completely in the moment. Their staff handle correspondence, make appointments, interrupt those appointments when a more important one is waiting, and help to plan their days for maximum efficiency (including naps!). Their bills are paid on time, their car is serviced when required, they&#x2019;re given reminders of projects due, and their assistants send suitable gifts to the HSP&#x2019;s loved ones on birthdays and anniversaries. Their ultimate prize if it all works?

The present edition marks a long-overdue return to availability of what is certainly his masterwork. Glastonbury is a small town in Somerset that by legend was home to King Arthur, and some of its ruins are infused with the spirit of long-gone ideals like the Holy Grail. Building on that base, Powys has constructed a towering edifice of faith, greed and cynicism, as a wealthy industrialist tries to exploit the town's mines, a skeptic cynically plans to bring in money by exploiting the legends and many people of varying degrees of faith and idealism are caught in between. Powys's gifts are enormous: he has an eye for nature, and its mystical power, akin to Wordsworth's; his sense of rustic scene and character is the equal of Hardy; his sharp-eyed view of business and politics reminds one of Shaw; and his sense of the endless subtleties of the relationships between men and women is, if anything, more encompassing than D. H. Lawrence's. His leisurely tale is told in prose that ranges from poetic miniatures to extended passages of the most dazzling rhetoric. It's a long book that requires the closest attention; but those who fall under its spell will be rewarded by one of this century's masterpieces of the novel. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Geese: A Complete Guide to Raising the Home Flock</h2><p>This handbook is meant to be used as a guide, not a golden rule.

During the Third Reich, German Protestant theologians, motivated by racism and tapping into traditional Christian anti-Semitism, redefined Jesus as an Aryan and Christianity as a religion at war with Judaism. In 1939, these theologians established the Institute for the Study and Eradication of Jewish Influence on German Religious Life. In <i>The Aryan Jesus</i>, Susannah Heschel shows that during the Third Reich, the Institute became the most important propaganda organ of German Protestantism, exerting a widespread influence and producing a nazified Christianity that placed anti-Semitism at its theological center.</p><br><p> Based on years of archival research, <i>The Aryan Jesus</i> examines the membership and activities of this controversial theological organization. With headquarters in Eisenach, the Institute sponsored propaganda conferences throughout the Nazi Reich and published books defaming Judaism, including a dejudaized version of the New Testament and a catechism proclaiming Jesus as the savior of the Aryans. Institute members--professors of theology, bishops, and pastors--viewed their efforts as a vital support for Hitler's war against the Jews. Heschel looks in particular at Walter Grundmann, the Institute's director and a professor of the New Testament at the University of Jena. Grundmann and his colleagues formed a community of like-minded Nazi Christians who remained active and continued to support each other in Germany's postwar years.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Aryan Jesus</i> raises vital questions about Christianity's recent past and the ambivalent place of Judaism in Christian thought.</p></p><p><p>"Susannah Heschel's <i>The Aryan Jesus</i> is a brilliant and erudite investigation of the convergence between major trends in German Protestantism and Nazi racial anti-Semitism. By concentrating on the history of the Institute for the Study and Eradication of Jewish Influence on German Religious Life, Heschel describes in forceful detail the Nazification of all aspects of Protestant theology, including the Aryanization of Jesus himself. This is a highly original and important contribution to our understanding of the Third Reich."--<b>Saul Friedlander, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"Susannah Heschel's fascinating, well-documented study not only reveals how and why German theologians during the Nazi period sought to dejudaize the church; it also exposes a perverted exegesis and theology that is still found, tragically, in pulpit, pew, and classroom."--<b>Amy-Jill Levine, author of <i>The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus</i></b></p><p>"Based on mostly unknown archival material, this pathbreaking book digs deep into the most sensitive areas of Nazi Germany's treatment of the Jews.

This is the &#x2018;gateless gate&#x2019;: only the seeing that david never was... <p>What would you give to know, absolutely know beyond any doubt, that everything really is all right, that there is no reason to fear. That there is no need to feel despair or loss or uncertainty. That all the pain and hurt and evil we have seen truly is only an illusion, and that the most beautiful things we have experienced are only a glimpse, a small taste, of what is truly real, and truly ours. That everything is all right; that everything is perfect as it is; that all is well. This is what I see, and what I know... </p><p>At the end of human vision lies the final, ultimate Truth, inasmuch as such can be at all within our vision even at its extreme limit. It cannot be experienced or thought of or spoken of because it cannot be conceptualized... This ultimate Beingness and ultimate Consciousness overflows constantly in the Outpouring of its essence, its nature, which is pure absolute love beyond our conceptions of love: complete compassion, total truth, ultimate beauty, Outpouring... </p><p>All of this, everything everywhere, is not as it appears. This energy which everything is, is Consciousness, Being, outpouring itself in itself. This is what is called Ananda, because the very nature of Consciousness outpouring in itself is perfect love, wonder, beauty, gratitude, completion. Bliss. This streaming is what is perceived as all this, all this crazy world. But in truth, when seen as it is, this car is not a car, these groceries are not groceries, they are pure love light consciousness bliss streaming here. </p><p>This is obvious. It is seen here always; once seen it cannot not be seen. It is inexpressible. There is no way I can communicate this without sounding like a blathering nut case. But it is true. All is well. All is so incredibly well. Everyone is asleep and does not see it. How can anything, the smallest thing, not be well? Everything, the smallest thing, is &#x2018;God&#x2019;, is all that is, pure awareness, pure love, outpouring as itself... </p><p>When there is total letting go of the idea of being a separate self, then what is seen is the love compassion bliss that you are and that the slightest thing is. If nothing else, trust me on this. All is perfection, pure bliss love outpouring. Any perceptions to the contrary are simply not true. All is well.

In the summer of 1944, Denis Avey was being held in a British POW labour camp, E715, near Auschwitz III. He had heard of the brutality meted out to the prisoners there and he was determined to witness what he could. He hatched a plan to swap places with a Jewish inmate and smuggled himself into his sector of the camp. He spent the night there on two occasions and experienced at first-hand the cruelty of a place where slave workers, had been sentenced to death through labor. Astonishingly, he survived to witness the aftermath of the Death March where thousands of prisoners were murdered by the Nazis as the Soviet Army advanced. After his own long trek right across central Europe he was repatriated to Britain.

He secures a job transforming London's sewer system and begins to lay his ghosts to rest. Above ground, his work is increasingly compromised by corruption, and cholera epidemics threaten the city. But it is only when the peace of the tunnels is shattered by murder that William loses his tenuous hold on sanity. Implicated in the crime, plagued by visions and nightmares, even he is not sure of his innocence. Long Arm Tom, who scavenges for valuables in the subterranean world of the sewers and cares for nothing and no one but his dog, Lady, is William's only hope of salvation. Will he bring the truth to light? <br><br>With extraordinarily vivid characters and unflinching prose that recall Year of Wonders and The Dress Lodger, The Great Stink marks the debut of an outstandingly talented writer in the tradition of the best historical novelists. <br><br></p><p>It takes a world of confidence to name your debut novel <i>The Great Stink</i>, and to set it in a sewer. Not even a modern sewer--charmless though that may be--but the crumbling, cholera-laden, rat-infested, fungus-rich sewers of London in the mid-Victorian period, from which pockets of deadly gas frequently burbled to the surface. Clare Clark's unsavory but completely absorbing first novel is a Dantean tour of this reeking underworld and its denizens: both the scavengers--human and animal--and the reformers, who brave the tunnels in the service of public hygiene and social progress after the 1858 Act of Parliament that called for the rebuilding of the sewer system. <p> <i>The Great Stink</i> juxtaposes two darknesses, both embodied in the filthy tunnels: the lawless desperation of the very poor, and the despair of madness. One of the junior engineers most useful in mapping the existing sewer is William May, a studious, methodical veteran of the Crimean War who manages to conceal from everyone but his wife the horrors he brought out of battle with him. The tunnels don't frighten William; they provide isolation and silence for the bloody rites that keep the Mr. Hyde in him at bay. It seems only a matter of time before William's self-destruction turns outward. Long Arm Tom, his counterpart among the poor, is a "tosher." He enters the tunnels illegally, scraping the sludge for coins or other booty, and trapping hundreds of rats for fighting against dogs at local taverns (all the rage for sporting gentlemen since dog fights have been outlawed). Kindness is a liability in Tom's world, but two acts of pity--one toward a dog, and one, more grudgingly, toward William--provide the resistance that changes the course of this otherwise relentlessly dire story. </p><p> The very weak-stomached may need a cup of mint tea or a bowl of potpourri beside them as they wade through the sewer with Tom and William. Clark has spared readers none of the stink, nor the sharp pleasures of suspense. <i>--�Regina Marler</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2005, 0-15-101161-3<br></p><h2>The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress</h2><p><p>For acclaimed historian William Jelani Cobb, the historic election of Barack Obama to the presidency is not the most remarkable development of the 2008 election; even more so is the fact that Obama won some 90 percent of the black vote in the primaries across America despite the fact that the established black leadership since the civil rights era&#x2015;men like Jesse Jackson, John Lewis, Andrew Young, who paved the way for his candidacy&#x2015;all openly supported Hillary Clinton. Clearly a sea change has occurred among black voters, ironically pushing the architects of the civil rights movement toward the periphery at the moment when their political dreams were most fully realized.<br>How this has happened, and the powerful implications it holds for America's politics and social landscape, is the focus of <i>The Substance of Hope</i>, a deeply insightful, paradigm-shifting examination of a new generation of voters that has not been shaped by the raw memory of Jim Crow and has a different range of imperatives. Cobb sees Obama's ascendancy as "a reality that has been taking shape in tiny increments for the past four decades," and examines thorny issues such as the paradox and contradictions embodied in race and patriotism, identity and citizenship; how the civil rights leadership became a political machine; why the term "postracial" is as iniquitous as it is inaccurate; and whether our society has really changed with Obama's election.<br>Elegantly written and powerfully argued, <i>The Substance of Hope </i>challenges conventional wisdom as it offers original insight into America's future.</p></p><p>Wiliam Jelani Cobb, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor of History at Spelman College in Atlanta.

Is violence a necessary aspect of the hero? And daring? Why did the cult of the hero flower in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in a way it hadn't for two hundred years? Was the figure of Nelson&#x2014;intemperate, charming, theatrical, anxious, impetuous, considerate, indifferent to death and danger, inspirational to those around him, and, above all, fixed on attack and victory&#x2014;an aberration in Enlightenment England? Or was the greatest of all English military heroes simply the product of his time, "the conjurer of violence" that England, at some level, deeply needed?</p><p>It is a story rich with modern resonance. This was a battle fought for the control of a global commercial empire. It was won by the emerging British world power, which was widely condemned on the continent of Europe as "the arrogant usurper of the freedom of the seas." Seize the Fire not only vividly describes the brutal realities of battle but enters the hearts and minds of the men who were there; it is a portrait of a moment, a close and passionately engaged depiction of a frame of mind at a turning point in world history.</p></p><p>On October 21, 1805, the British navy crushed the combined fleets of Spain and France near Spain's Cape Trafalgar, thwarting Napoleon Bonaparte's planned invasion of England and leading to a century of British maritime dominance. There are many books on the Battle of Trafalgar, but this one is different in that Adam Nicolson focuses more on "the mental landscape" of those who fought than on the battle itself. In analyzing why the British scored such an impressive victory, Nicolson looks beyond tactics to study the collective psychology of the three navies, along with the social and cultural forces at work. Part of the study revolves around the concept of the hero at the dawn of the 19th century. The men who fought at Trafalgar "looked on battle not as a necessary evil but as a moment of revelation and truth" that played into their conception of purpose, honor, and duty to king and country--with violence seen as an integral part of duty. No one fit the classic model of the hero more than Admiral Lord Nelson, the "most feared naval commander in the world"; a man who saw himself as a "prophetic agent of apocalypse and millennium" destined to lead England to global dominance. Nelson became the model of the British hero for the rest of the century and beyond. <p> In addition to an in-depth study of Nelson's background and psychology, Nicolson discusses the cultural differences between the three countries. For instance, in England, a non-aristocrat like Nelson was allowed to rise to the top--an occurrence that would have been impossible in both France and Spain given their strict societal codes. Each nation's motivation was different as well. Spain's social system was based on aristocratic chivalry, while France was acting according to the authoritative whim of Napoleon. Britain, however, was motivated by trade, and Nicolson discusses how England was able to finance its powerful navy by taxing the growing middle class and their seemingly limitless desire for material goods, making Trafalgar "the first great bourgeois victory of European history." <i>Seize the Fire</i> provides an intriguing perspective on one of the great naval battles in history. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><p>Adam Nicols on is the author of <em>Seamanship</em>, <em>God's Secretaries</em>, and <em>Seize the Fire</em>.

Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>Our Solar System</h2><p><p>Our Solar System was born almost 5 billion years ago at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy.

But when he meets the hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York, he is certain. For York doesn't care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out all but one of Marsh's dilapidated fleet. Nor does he care that he won't earn back his investment in a decade. York has his own reasons for wanting to traverse the powerful Mississippi. And they are to be none of Marsh's concern--no matter how bizarre, arbitrary, or capricious his actions may prove. <br>Marsh meant to turn down York's offer. It was too full of secrets that spelled danger. But the promise of both gold and a grand new boat that could make history crushed his resolve--coupled with the terrible force of York's mesmerizing gaze.

Ironically, our own society has evolved into a similar system of rewriting history. However unlike that society described by Orwell, those rewriting our history have engaged in a much more effective and insidious process, with only a few hints from time to time to suggest anything might be amiss. Most citizens in the West spend their whole lifetimes blissfully unaware that they have been fed a carefully edited view of the past, tailored to prop up the powers that be and keep humanity ignorant of their own past and the dangers that the past presents in the here and now. Where Orwell&#39;s Big Brother was overtly aggressive in his rule, today&#39;s ruling elite are every secretive and hide behind various media outlets, scientific organizations, government offices, and secret societies. Their control is not infinite or complete, but it comes close with only those willing to self publish or post on the Internet generally being able to circumvent their control. Later in this book I will be outlining who these secret rulers are (and have presented a fuller picture of their secrets and goals in my previous books Genesis 6 Giants - Master Builders of Prehistoric and Ancient Civilizations, and Angel Wars: Past, Present, Future).1 In these books I&#39;ve documented both how there is definitive proof of the existence of giants and other terrifying creatures both in the form of artifacts as well as historical accounts (echoed in mythology) and will also note how the physical proof is regularly spirited away and destroyed or quietly deposited in obscure museums and dark back rooms where the public is never allowed.</p><p></p><h2>THE CLINICAL PRACTICE OF CHINESE MEDICINE</h2><p>from the author&#39;s site: &#34;This work explicates how to achieve the core value system at the heart of Nourishing Destiny in clinical practice. All treatment paradigms are fully elaborated to allow immediate integration into the clinic. I cover in detail the points on the 12 main channels cross referencing every character in every main and alternate point name to Weiger&#39;s etymological text and to Mathews&#39; Chinese-English dictionary. I also fully elaborate the Worsley five-element tradition with a fresh perspective for the twenty first century. A chapter on Clearing Blocks with Chinese Herbs contains a beautifully written piece by Thea Elijah on treating possession, exit/entry blocks, and clearing the sensory orifices with herbal medicine. A 60 page chapter discusses the in depth use of the five element points on each channel with an eye toward engendering the integral consciousness that lies at the heart of Chinese medicine. In conclusion I examine the four thousand year history of Chinese Medicine from the perspective of Spiral Dynamics, a model that yields deep insight into the evolution of consciousness. I examine where Chinese medicine has been, where it is, and where it needs to go if it is to fulfill its potential as a leading edge wholistic/integral medicine.&#34; from the forward: &#34;Lonny Jarrett has written another book in his unmistakable style. This work must be read as the autobiography of a master practitioner who shows us his roots, his growth process, and the amalgamation of Chinese medicine with everything he is, thinks, and knows--all in the spirit of inspiring the same.&#34; - Heiner Fruehauf, Chair, Dept of Classical Chinese Medicine, NCNM</p><p></p><h2>The da Vinci Notebooks</h2><p>A selection of sketches, diagrams, and notebook writings by the Italian Renaissance master offers insight into his theories and observations as well as his role in period art, town planning, science, philosophy, and other venues. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>AUTHORBIO: Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian painter, sculptor, architect, musician, engineer, and scientist.

Campbell&#39;s Don A Stuart stories.</p><p>NESFA's program of keeping classic sf authors in print in bulk turns to legendary editor John W. Campbell's stories published under the pseudonym Don A. Stuart. Justly famous for encouraging and publishing such young writers as Sturgeon, Heinlein, and Asimov in sf's 1930s golden age, Campbell was an exceptional writer himself. In just a few years, he wrote some of the most enduring sf stories, including "Who Goes There?," about a deadly, chameleonic alien stranded at an arctic scientific station, which, as <i>The Thing</i>, has twice been successfully filmed. Other stories, such as "Twilight," a melancholy vision of a humanity doomed to extinction by the loss of curiosity, and "Out of Night," in which a trio of humans determine to free themselves from an oppressive race called the Sarn, are equally powerful. Campbell's concentration on ideas means that his characters tend to be wooden archetypes whose moods are, well, moody. Still, he is a remarkable student of human psychology. Historically minded sf fans, in particular, will enjoy reading more Campbell than "Who Goes There?" <i>Roberta Johnson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Versace's fashion is about such bold and unequivocal choices. Unafraid of being denounced by those less daring and more fearful than himself, he makes fashion meant to be worn by those who share his desire for risk--who share his honesty about sexuality and his self-confidence in aesthetic choice. Traditionally, fashion designers begin with innovations in their first collections, develop fans and followers, and ultimately settle into a style that is the designer's trademark, with modest adaptations to the season and fashion currents. Gianni Versace is different. The <i>New York Times</i> remarked on a 1996 showing: "Gianni Versace ended the day with his collection, dedicated to 'a woman who listens to classical music but enjoys rock, who reads <i>The New Yorker</i> and Calvino but can have a laugh at gossipy chronicles, who adores wearing Versace with Calvin Klein jeans or Versace jeans with a Chanel jacket.' If that sounds like a personal ad . . . it could be, because Mr. Versace is not setting up housekeeping with clients who have married him in the past; he is always courting someone new." Indeed, Versace is an uncompromising designer--one who develops and expands not only in the public arena of fashion but also in the even larger area of popular culture.<br><br>Versace's energy has become famous; he makes it clear both as a designer and as a human being that he prizes life. Already by the late 1970's, Gianni Versace was in command of his distinctive style. He was able to combine absolute power and authority with comfortable materials and a relaxed silhouette. Even then he was designing the most confident clothing of his time. Who else, after all, would combine silk and leather with the panache of American sportswear? Who else would have let the pleats in the silk blouse become the center of ever-widening ripples that make troughs in the soft leather skirt? While Versace's designs are celebrated as unabashedly sexual, they nonetheless possess a strong sense of personal grace. Versace shows an unerring talent for bringing from the street those extravagant and graceful elements that represent the best in contemporary style. No major designer living today has more successfully transfigured the street's reality into convincing style--all the while keeping in sight the extravagant possibilities of Baroque and Renaissance motifs. Versace understands, perhaps better than any designer of his time, that fashion's place in the world is at the center of visual spectacle. With intelligent commentary and celebrated photographs of Versace designs, this book presents the Versace spectacle in all its boldness and sensuality.<br><br>In this volume, we see Versace at once as the designer of the Byzantine Madonna, of the performer of Madonna, of modern sportswear infused with Italian Renaissance pageantry, of 1930's-inspired slinky gowns, and of an entirely new 1990's couture vision.<br></p><p>These small (61/4 " x 81/4") books, the first in a new series, offer capsule introductions to the achievements of three of the most important designers of this century. Berge, Saint Laurent's partner since the couturier's sensational 1962 debut, writes a brief seven-page homage to Saint Laurent's artistry, followed by 52 photographs of his most significant designs, which changed women's fashions. Carefully selected, the illustrations also show the artworks and the environment that inspired Saint Laurent. Martin, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute, offers an insightful analysis of recently deceased Italian designer Versace's eye-opening fashions, which juxtapose silk with leather, street style with couture, in an unmistakable signature. Forty-nine photographs illustrate representative works of the last 15 years. Tretiack manages to summarize the house of Cartier's 150-year history into a succinct 16-page essay. While Cartier designed fancy clocks and desk accessories as well, it is the fabulous jewels that are featured here and that the reader will recognize. Certainly, these books do not approach some of the serious, in-depth publications of recent years (e.g., Yves Saint Laurent: Images of Design, 1958-1988, 1988. o.p.) or the weighty and expensive coffee-table tomes (e.g., Versace's Men Without Ties, Abbeville, 1996), but for libraries with small budgets, these quality publications can provide economical introductions to designers with whom most readers should be acquainted.?Therese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ.

Neither omnipotent nor omniscient, head god Dahlaine, his brother Veltan and their two sisters aren't even particularly bright. The Vlagh, an evil insectoid creature that's trying to take over the world by producing an army of mutated snake people, goes south to carry the fight for domination to Veltan's realm. The dreamers (the younger gods) forecast the coming horde and provide enough information for Dahlaine and his siblings to prepare themselves. Indeed, the gods' preparations for one rather tedious, unexciting battle occupy the bulk of the book. This fantasy comes as a great letdown from the authors of the luminous Belgariad series (<i>Pawn of Prophecy</i>, etc.). No true hero shines forth, and the gods' powerlessness makes them worse than cardboard cutouts. Filled with second- or even third-hand action, the story lacks urgency. The next volume desperately needs to be better in order to save the series. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I urged her. "There's a spring here that the valley folk say gives the best water in the whole forest. That's if it hasn't dried up." <p>It hadn't dried up. At the foot of the slope on the forest side of the road, an unexpected outflow of water formed a pool about as big as the circle of a man's arms. The water--too copious, almost, to have sprung from such small beginnings--made a channel that ran down to the valley. Beside the pool stood a number of outdoor hearths, some new, some old, the clay and stones charred black and hideous inside. In my childhood, my friends and I had built just such a hearth by the spring, and cooked rice and made soup there. In a twice-yearly ritual, each of us chose the group he would camp out with, thereby determining the division of forces among the children of the valley. The outing lasted only two days each spring and autumn, but the influence of the groups thus formed by the children remained valid throughout the year. Nothing was so humiliating as to be expelled from the group one had joined. </p><p>As I bent down over the spring to drink from it directly, I had a sudden sense of certainty: certainty that everything--the small round pebbles, grayish blue and vermilion and white, lying at the bottom of water whose brightness seemed still to harbor the midday light; the fine sand that swirled upward, clouding it ever so slightly; and the faint shiver that ran over the surface of the water--was just as I'd seen it twenty years before; a certainty, born of longing yet to myself, at least, utterly convincing, that the water now welling up so ceaselessly was exactly the same water that had welled up and flowed away in those days. And the same certainty developed directly into a feeling that the "I" bending down there now was not the child who had once bent his bare knees there, that there was no continuity, no consistency between the two "I's," that the "I" now bending down there was a remote stranger. The present "I" had lost all true identity. Nothing, either within me or without, offered any hope of recovery. </p><p>I could hear the transparent ripples on the pool tinkling, accusing me of being no better than a rat. I shut my eyes and sucked up the cold water. My gums shrank, leaving a taste of blood on my tongue. As I stood up, my wife bent down in obedient imitation, as though I was an authority on how to drink from the spring. In fact, I was as complete a stranger to the spring by now as she, who had just come through the forest for the first time. I shuddered. The bitter cold penetrated my consciousness again. Shivering, my wife stood up too and tried to smile to show that the water had tasted good; but her teeth as her purple lips shrank back merely seemed to be bared in anger. Shoulder to shoulder, silent and shuddering with cold, we returned to the jeep. Takashi averted his eyes as though he'd seen something too pitiful to look on.</p></p><h2>Memory Babe: A Critical Biography of Jack Kerouac</h2><p>In 1969 Jack Kerouac died a premature death.

Original and eloquent, this new book looks at the connection between the economy and nature, arguing that the principles of development, common to both systems, are the proper subject of economic study.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>The Nature of Economies</i> is written in the form of a Platonic dialogue, a conversation over coffee among five contemporary New Yorkers. The question they discuss is: Does economic life obey the same rules as those governing the systems in nature? For example, can the way fields and forests maximize their intakes and uses of sunlight teach us something about how economies expand wealth and jobs and can do this in environmentally beneficial ways? The underlying question is both simple and profound, and the answers that emerge will shape the way people think about how economies really work. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>The New York Times</i> described Jane Jacobs's <i>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</i> as "first of all a work of literature." The accessibility of her prose--<i>The New Criterion</i> called it "majestic"--stands as Jacobs's hallmark. She is the rarest of analytic thinkers, both an economic visionary and an artist. Examining complex systems with the wit, style, and clear eye of the masterly essayist, in <i>The Nature of Economies</i> Jacobs once again accomplishes the near impossible: She fundamentally challenges some of the established principles of economics while writing in a style that enthralls the general reader.</p><p>Over the past 40 years, Jane Jacobs has produced an acclaimed series of analytical essays that examine the development of complex human systems and environments in a manner that's as literary as it is visionary. Her latest, <i>The Nature of Economies</i>, continues this artistic and provocative tradition by dissecting relationships between economics and ecology through a multilayered discourse around the fundamental premise that "human beings exist wholly within nature as part of a natural order." In a style reminiscent of the cinematic <i>My Dinner with Andre</i>, Jacobs gives us a captivating ongoing conversation between five contemporary New Yorkers who sip coffee and voice accepted, fact-based theories along with subjective but solid opinions regarding the way our society's fractal-like development is actually dependent upon "the same universal principles that the rest of nature uses." Digressing onto various and sundry paths as such dialogues always do--albeit, this time, on a very specific and methodical route as prescribed by Jacobs--the characters mull over business cycles, animal husbandry, habitat destruction, the implications of standardization and monopoly, competition in nature, the obsolescence of computers, and much, much more. This book is recommended for the eclectically curious who welcome the opportunity to eavesdrop on such stimulating table talk, even while lamenting the fact they can't join in. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>"What does Jane Jacobs do? She thinks and she writes books that have enormous impact around the world, particularly among urban planners, architects and economist."--Sid Adilman, The Toronto Star<br><br>"[Jacob's] prose is majestic: difficult ideas are expounded with great clarity--I believe that she has few peers among living American writers of prose."--Francis Morrone, The New Criterion<br><br>"Jane Jacobs is an indispensable provocateur."--D.

It&#x2019;s a shitshow out there.</i> No one in the bubbles of Washington, DC., New York, or Los Angles was talking about it--least of all the media. LeDuff wanted to go to the heart of the country to report what was really going on. Ailes baulked. Could the hard-living and straight-shooting LeDuff be controlled? But, then, perhaps on a whim, he agreed. And so LeDuff set out to record a TV series called, "The Americans," and, along the way, ended up bearing witness to the ever-quickening unraveling of The American Dream.<br><br>For three years, LeDuff travelled the width and breadth of the country with his team of production irregulars, ending up on the Mexican border crossing the Rio Grande on a yellow rubber kayak alongside undocumented immigrants; in the middle of Ferguson as the city burned; and watching the children of Flint get sick from undrinkable water. Racial, political, social, and economic tensions were escalating by the day. The inexorable effects of technological change and globalization were being felt more and more acutely, at the same time as wages stagnated and the price of housing, education, and healthcare went through the roof. The American people felt defeated and abandoned by their politicians, and those politicians seemed incapable of rising to the occasion. The old way of life was slipping away, replaced only by social media, part-time work, and opioid addiction.<br><br><i>Sh*tshow!</i> is that true, tragic, and distinctively American story, told from the parts of the country hurting the most. A soul-baring, irreverent, and iconoclastic writer, LeDuff speaks the language of everyday Americans, and is unafraid of getting his hands dirty. He scrambles the tired-old political, social, and racial categories, taking no sides--or prisoners. Old-school, gonzo-style reporting, this is both a necessary confrontation with the darkest parts of the American psyche and a desperately-needed reminder of the country's best instincts.</p><p>Charlie LeDuff is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, formerly at the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Detroit News, </i>and Detroit's Fox 2 News.

Although many attempts have been made to re-create the magnificent illustrations in Audubon's masterpiece, nothing equals the level of fidelity or scale achieved in this high-quality edition. <br>Organized and annotated by Roger Tory Peterson, AmericaG��s best-known ornithologist, and issued with the full endorsement and cooperation of the Audubon Society, this magnificent volume is as thorough in scientific classification as it is beautiful. Peterson's fascinating introduction places Audubon in the context of the history of American ornithological art and also reproduces a wide sampling of the work of Audubon's notable predecessors and disciples, including Peterson's own justly famous paintings. This new systematic arrangement of the prints, complete with informative commentaries about each bird, made it possible to correct many of the problems or errors in Audubon's original edition revealed by later scholarship. The colorful captions in the back provide fascinating commentaries on each featured bird.</p><p>Roger Tory Peterson has been regarded as America&#39;s most notable ornithologist following the publication of A Field Guide to the Birds in 1934. Like Audubon, Peterson received many honorary degrees and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Honor. Virginia Marie Peterson is a scientist and an expert on the environmental effects of oil spills.<b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>Like many another genius, John James Audubon was the right man in the right place at the right time.&#x201d; He came to America with a fresh eye when it was still possible to document some of our unspoiled wilderness. He was also, during his lifetime, witness to the rapid changes that were taking place. Audubon&#x2019;s real contribution was not the conservation ethic but awareness. That in itself is enough; awareness inevitably leads to concern.<br> <br>Audubon&#x2019;s frequent references to the palatability of birds and their availability in the market make us realize how far we have come in bird protection, if not in our epicurean tastes. He wrote that the Barred Owl was very often exposed for sale in the New Orleans market; the Creoles make Gumbo of it, and pronounce the flesh palatable.&#x201d; Not only does he speak with a gourmet&#x2019;s authority about the edibility of owls, loons, cormorants, and crows, but also the gustatory delights of juncos, white-throated sparrows, and robins.<br> <br>It may seem paradoxical that this prototype of the woodsman-huntsman should have become the father figure of the conservation movement in North America. Like most other pioneer ornithologists, he was literally in blood up to his elbows.&#x201d; He seemed obsessed with shooting; far more birds fell to his gun than he needed for drawing or research or for food. He once said that it was not a really good day unless he shot a hundred birds. But in his later writings, when recounting old shooting forays, there is a note of regret, as though his conscience were bothering him about the excesses of his trigger-happy days. He deplored the slaughter, especially when perpetrated by others a double standard, if you will. But only once did he ask forgiveness for his acts. After describing the carnage that took place in the Florida Keys when he and his party landed in a colony of cormorants, committing frightful havoc among them,&#x201d; he wrote: You must try to excuse these murders, which in truth might not have been so numerous had I not thought of you [the reader] quite as often while on the Florida Keys, with the burning sun over my head and my body oozing at every pore, as I do now while peaceably scratching my paper with an iron pen, in one of the comfortable and quite cool houses of Old Scotland.&#x201d;<br> <br>Repeatedly in his writings he reveals this dual nature, or inner conflict. After finding the nest of a pair of least sandpipers he wrote, I was truly sorry to rob them of their eggs, although impelled to do so by the love of science, which offers a convenient excuse for even worse acts.&#x201d; Again, when he first met the arctic tern in the Magdalene Islands: As I admire its easy and graceful motions, I felt agitated with a desire to possess it. Our guns were accordingly charged with mustard-seed shot, and one after another you might have seen the gentle birds come whirling down upon the water Alas, poor things! How well do I remember the pain it gave me, to be thus obliged to pass and execute sentence upon them. At that very moment I thought of those long past times when individuals of my own species were similarly treated; but I excused myself with plea of necessity, as I recharged my double gun.&#x201d; Another example of Audubon&#x2019;s compulsion to shoot.<br> <br>In light of his record it would seem inappropriate that one of the foremost conversation organizations in the United States should adopt Audubon&#x2019;s name, but not so. He was ahead of his time. Like so many thoughtful sportsmen since, he eventually developed a conservation conscience. In an era when there were no game laws, no national parks or refuges, when there was no environmental ethic, when vulnerable nature gave way to human pressures and often sheer stupidity, he was a witness who sounded the alarm. He became more and more concerned during his later travels when, with the perspective of his years, he could see the trend. He noticed that prairie chickens, wild turkeys, Carolina parakeets, and many other birds were no longer as numerous as he once knew them. He wrote vividly and passionately about what he saw. He pondered the future, and some of the passages of his writing were prophetic.<br> <br>Audubon could not have known that because of his artistry and his writing his name would become a household word, synonymous with birds, wildlife, and conservation. The National Audubon Society, formerly known as the National Association of Audubon Societies, was launched in the early years of this century, when no one spoke of ecology&#x201d; or environment.&#x201d; It was primarily a bird organization at first. Over the years the Society has gone through a philosophical metamorphosis. Bird-watching was the precursor of ecological awareness, and Audubon&#x201d; has become a symbol of the environmental movement.<br> <br>John James Audubon received high honors during the two decades prior to his death in 1851, but his greatest fame came in the century that followed. He had sparked a latent nationwide interest in the natural world, especially its birds, and his name became enshrined in hundreds of streets, towns, and parks across the land. Even a mountain peak in the Rockies is named in his honor. In the section of New York City where he lived there is an Audubon Avenue, an Audubon Theatre, an, now translated into digits, an Audubon telephone exchange. There was even a group that called themselves the Audubon Artists,&#x201d; although they did not draw birds. But the greatest monument to his name is the National Audubon Society, which, unlike the Audubon gun clubs&#x201d; before the turn of the century, reflects the other side of John James Audubon, the passionate concern for the survival of wildlife and wild America that he developed as he grew older.<br></p><h2>The Garden Book</h2><p>&#34;The Garden Book&#34; presents a diverse range of garden and landscape designers responsible for some of the most interesting and iconic gardens of all time from around the world. Gardens of Ancient Persia, the Moguls of India, and the palaces of Chinese Emperors sit side by side with contemporary gardens from the USA, Europe and Australia. Formal geometric Modernist gardens of France contrast with the traditional sweeping landscapes of the Romantic English country garden. Long-vanished wonders such as the mythical gardens of Babylon, Paradise and Eden are illustrated by artists&#39; impressions and rare illuminated manuscripts. This volume presents 500 designers in an A-Z format that departs from the usual emphasis on genres and time periods, encouraging readers to contemplate the connections between gardens, social history and popular culture. The designers selected represent a broad variety of styles, structure and planting. Experts, as well as readers coming to garden history for the first time, should find many well-loved and familiar gardens, alongside many that are rarely explored in contemporary garden books. The gardens have beem selected in an effort to choose the appropriate work for key figures in garden design and which illustrates their influence on the traditions of gardening in many countries around the world. They range, therefore, from the palaces of kings to the all-consuming passions, bordering on obsessions, of amateur enthusiasts. Notable examples from countries with a strong tradition of garden design, France, Italy, Japan and China, as well as lesser known examples from the Pacific Rim, Poland and the Czech Republic, should complement some of the great estates of the UK and USA. In some cases, the designer has been responsible for a large number of gardens and often lesser known examples have been chosen for their importance in the development of garden design. Throughout history, the estates of the wealthy have often been where the major movements of garden design have taken place, and often the patron will develop the garden beyond what can have been expected by the original designer. Written in an easily accessible way, the text explains the chosen figure&#39;s role in the development of the garden, as well as the important changes to the garden over time. Each designer is represented by a full-page illustration, mostly in colour, of their most significant garden and an accompanying text that describes the image and discusses the type of garden and its role in the further development of the tradition. Each page includes cross-references to other designers working in a similar style, movement, or time period, as well as biographical information about the designer, and complete data on the garden reproduced.</p><p>&#39;Small but perfectly informed ...

Tour.</p><p>A loosely affiliated collection of pieces culled from <i>Harper's</i> and the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>The Book of Guys</i> supplies Garrison Keillor's brand of pathos-inspired belly laughs in great measure. Since Keillor is not only, by all appearances, a mensch but also the possessor of an extremely amiable voice in his writing (and who can say, with him, where his prose voice ends and the aural one begins?), you tend to forget the darker elements of his work. In fact, those are the things that make his writing so amusing. <p> <i>The Book of Guys</i> parades a collection of Joe Nobodies, average guys like Garry Keillor, "sixteen, six foot two, with the metabolism of a wolverine." But these are guys with a darker side: longings, misgivings, psychoses. There's Lonesome Shorty, the cowboy who lusts for town life, but as soon as he settles down, the trail calls him again. Or the mayor of Zenith, who has everything a man could want, his life darkened solely by a senseless vendetta carried out by the editor of the local newspaper. "I have spent thirty minutes [writing this letter to the Editor] and my wife, her black hair tumbling over her bare shoulders touched with freckles under the pale-blue gossamer negligee hanging light as a leaf on her pale breasts and bold etcetera..." But Keillor's guys are too preoccupied with everyday angst to take hold of their good fortune. "In a minute, dear," says the mayor, continuing his screed.</p><p> <i>The Book of Guys</i> doesn't give one much faith in the future of male-dom, but it is funny. And don't let the paucity of competition fool you; Keillor's a humorist par excellence, a fine, thoughtful, and witty writer. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>Garrison Keillor is America's favorite storyteller.

He examines the critical issues that Boeing has faced in recent years, including its difficult merger with McDonnell Douglas, its controversial move from Seattle to Chicago, and a series of corporate scandals that made front-page news. And he analyzes the troubles that have beset a once ascendant Airbus, notably an institutional structure aimed at satisfying the narrowly focused interests of its European stakeholders. Newhouse also explores the problems that now face Boeing and Airbus alike: potential competition from China and Japan, the challenge of serving burgeoning Asian markets, and the need to undo years of mismanagement. <br><br><i>Boeing Versus Airbus</i> is a fascinating, informed, and insightful tale of success, and failure, in the turbulent, do-or-die world of the aircraft industry.</p><p>John Newhouse covered foreign policy for <i>The New Yorker</i> throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. He has served as assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and was senior policy adviser for European affairs in the U.S. State Department during the latter half of the Clinton administration. He is the author of eight other books, including <i>Cold Dawn</i> and <i>Europe Adrift</i>. He lives in Washington, D.C.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br><b>Being Number One</b><br>In the aircraft business, as in a Trollope novel, things are often not what they seem. In the 1980s, Boeing still reigned supreme. Its airplanes covered the market. Its product support was exemplary. Boeing was universally judged one of America's best and most admired companies, partly because its sales abroad of big commercial airplanes were the country's biggest export, and partly because it had learned to build these airplanes better, faster, and cheaper than anyone elso had done. "World-class" was Boeing's lofty but accurate characterization of itself.<br><br>The competition was barely visible. McDac had entered its steady but terminal decline, and in Seattle, Boeing's home base, Airbus was seen as just another in a long line of European wannabes that would stay in the game only as long as a consortium of governments remained willing to throw vast sums of money at a seemingly certain loser. Today, things have turned around. Boeing and Airbus are the sole suppliers of big airliners, but over many of the past twenty years, the two companies were moving in opposite directions. Boeing's multiple troubles, most of them self-inflicted, signaled an end to its dominance and pointed up Airbus's methodical rise.<br><br>Things had begun to change in the late 1980s. And it was no joke when, on April 1, 1993, Moody's downgraded Boeing's debt rating for the first time in the company's seventy-six-year history. Still, as late as 1990, Boeing held 62 percent of the market, McDonnell Douglas 23 percent, Airbus just 15 percent. Today it's very different. McDonnell Douglas is gone, having been absorbed by Boeing in August 1997. In 2004, Airbus outsold Boeing, and did so again in 2005.<br><br>Boeing's troubles were traceable partly to arrogance&#x2014;a tendency to take the market for granted, to coast on its laurels&#x2014;and partly to changes that developed in the corporate culture. These changes began to dull Boeing's feel for the game, a game in which the supplier must either take large risks with operating margins or make way for the competition. Then there is the legacy of obsolescence. So much is invested in existing systems that a Boeing or an Airbus cannot absorb the new technologies except in small bites. Nevertheless, whatever the cost, they must invest in these technologies, even while being manipulated in a way that drives down the cost of new airplanes to a point at which the financially strapped airlines can afford to buy them. "You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't quit," said Jean Pierson, a former CEO of Airbus, who understood the need to invest in research and technology.<br><br>The industry has produced few more interesting figures than Pierson. He is a legend. Experienced people at the Airbus offices in Toulouse agree that without Jean Pierson, who retired in 1998, there would be no Airbus. This is a people industry, even if it is technology driven. Those who succeed are individuals with vision and guts and a sure sense of their company's interests, as distinct from their own (or even those of their stockholders). Pierson defined the model of what it takes. He had the requisite vision, guts, common sense, and the personal force to persuade colleagues at Airbus to do things his way and to persuade customers&#x2014;including wary, skeptical American carriers&#x2014;to buy his airplanes instead of Boeing's.<br><br>Pierson was known as "the bear of the Pyrenees." He now spends some of his time in Nice and the rest in Corsica&#x2014;in the mountains behind a small port not far from Bastia. He keeps a small boat there, a farewell gift from Airbus. And he does some indifferent fishing, not with tackle but with a string tied to his finger to which he attaches bait.<br><br>Pierson arrived as boss of Airbus in 1985, just when T. Wilson (the <i>T</i> is for Thornton, but he was known throughout the aviation world and beyond as "T"), a figure very like him in a number of ways, retired as Boeing's chief executive. Wilson, like Pierson, was a vivid, dominating, sure-handed leader. And just as Pierson's arrival marked the start of Airbus's ascent, Wilson's departure marked the start of Boeing's decline. The fortunes of Boeing and Airbus were both closely tied to the style and the aura of these two remarkable leaders whose paths barely crossed.<br><br>Each of them got on well with and had the respect of his opposite numbers in the airline and engine businesses, partly because they were both hands-on managers who knew airplanes from the wheels up. Both had been factory-floor guys who knew what was involved in the various blue-collar jobs. At Airbus, they say, Pierson would talk to employees in these jobs and then, based on what he'd learned, might say to his staff, "We are going to be ten days late in delivering this or that airplane"&#x2014;meaning, "You guys better shape up right now or we will be paying heavy penalties for missing delivery dates."<br><br>Wilson would sit down with factory workers at lunch in the cafeteria and find out what was going on in their various operations; and then, if it was advisable, he would take up what he'd learned with the relevant managers. He wasn't Boeing's founder, but he was called "the founder" by some of his people. "He ran the company," says one former executive. "It did not run him. Wilson overrode the system whenever he had to."<br><br>Like Pierson, Wilson had an intuitive feel for his company's larger interests. He knew that Boeing had the world's greatest commercial aircraft franchise. He would do whatever it took to protect that. He never liked diversifying if it meant moving the company onto ground it knew less well or not at all. The point is best illustrated by anecdotal evidence. For example, Robert R. Kiley (an American who in 2001 would become the surprise choice to take over management of the London Underground) had a remarkable encounter with Wilson in 1975, when Kiley had just been named chairman and chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).<br><br>The MBTA had recently bought new trams, or streetcars. These vehicles had been supplied by Vertol, at the time a subdivision of Boeing, which had acquired it in 1960 (nearly a decade before Wilson took on major responsibilities). Kiley recalls the new equipment "as having quickly become a big and constant problem&#x2014;a horror story. It was sleek looking and very high-tech, too much so. The doors were a special problem. They had about a thousand moving parts, some of them electronically driven. The press reaction was awful. We intended to sue Boeing.<br><br>"One Saturday morning," Kiley continues, "I was alone in my office in Boston, and a guard downstairs called to say that a man named Wilson was there and wanted to see me. When I discovered it was T. Wilson, Boeing's CEO, I went down and brought him to my office. He was upset about what had happened, noting how sorry he was not to have stopped this move by Boeing into a technology it knew nothing about. He made clear his feeling that Boeing should not stray from the business it knew. He said, 'Mr. Kiley, my only interest is preserving my company's good name. I'll do whatever you want us to do.' He offered, in effect, to fix the trains or, failing that, repay the MBTA's investment&#x2014;about $45 million in mid-1970s dollars."1<br><br>The trams, which had never worked, couldn't be fixed, and so Boeing repaid the MBTA. For the company, it was the sensible and cost-effective solution to the problem. Not so long after Wilson stepped down, Boeing began to ignore the lesson it had learned with the MBTA: to keep the company focused on the business it knew best.<br><br>Boeing had prospered by concentrating on product development and the customer, assuming, correctly, that doing so would best protect shareholder interests. Movement away from these priorities was slow, but within ten years of Wilson's departure, Boeing had changed direction.<br>Airliners, like T-shirts, come in different sizes&#x2014;small, medium, large, and extra-large. But they have more variety than T-shirts, because the suppliers build each of their products into families; in turn, the family members, the airplanes, vary somewhat in size, range, and other characteristics, the better to fill each of the airline market's crevices.<br><br>The low end of the market is covered by two single-aisle airplanes, Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320. They are roughly the same size, seating up to 190 people. Both are exceptionally successful, having exceeded the most optimistic forecasts of their respective companies. The 737 is older and has been steadily improved over the years. But the A320, a newer, slightly larger, and more comfortable aircraft, is outselling the 737, not least in the low-cost market that Boeing had monopolized. In December 2004, the surge in orders for A320's from low-cost carriers caused Boeing to shake up its sales force and replace its chief salesman, Toby Bright.<br><br>The biggest revenue earners are airplanes with 200 to 300 seats. For many years, Boeing had this so-called middle market largely to itself with the 757, a long, single-aisle airplane, and the double-aisle 767. The narrower and less comfortable of the two, the 757, could seat up to 239 passengers, while the more popular 767 carries 218 to 304, depending on the version. The extended-range version of the family became the most profitable of all Boeing aircraft (a distinction widely but wrongly thought to belong to its 747 jumbo). This airplane's other distinction lay in becoming the first long-range, transatlantic, twin-engine airliner. It was quietly followed by the Airbus A310, which was less popular.<br><br>Then, in the mid-1990s, Airbus moved aggressively into this Boeing fiefdom with the A330-200, a new medium-size airplane that quickly became very popular with airlines as a vehicle for moving both people and cargo. The heavy demand for the A330-200 drove Boeing out of the middle market, the richest segment. In October 2003, it announ...</p><h2>The Oxford Companion to Popular Music</h2><p><em>Harper's</em> has called them "the best reference books in the language." And <em>The Boston Globe</em> wrote, "How did we ever get along before Oxford began to publish its thick, encyclopedic volumes which, modestly and accurately, it calls Companions?" From the redoubtable <em>Oxford Companion to English</em> <em>Literature</em> to the fascinating <em>Oxford Companion to the Mind</em>, these browsable volumes have long been acclaimed as goldmines of information, capturing in thousands of entries the essence of a particular field of interest.<br> Now comes the newest addition to the Companion series, <em>The Oxford Companion to Popular Music</em>, encompassing in one alphabetic sequence all that is notable within this vast subject, everything from jazz, reggae, blues, and calypso, to Broadway musicals, rock and roll, and country western. There are hundreds of biographical entries on such diverse figures as John Philip Sousa and Ma Rainey, Fred Astaire and Joan Baez, Josef Lanner (the Father of the Viennese Waltz) and Mistinguett, Otis Redding and Prince. The great Broadway writers, performers, and musicals (including plot outlines) are all here: Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern; "South Pacific," "West Side Story," "Show Boat," "Porgy and Bess"; Mary Martin, Ethel Merman, Fanny Brice, Robert Preston. It covers rock groups from The Beatles, to Led Zeppelin, to Talking Heads; jazz figures such as Fats Waller, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Bix Beiderbecke, and Louis Armstrong; folk singers such as Bob Dylan, Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, and Arlo Guthrie; and country western figures such as Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Merle Haggard, and Johnny Cash. Not the least important feature is the many informative essays on particular genres of popular music, from operetta and waltz, to vaudeville and blues, to brass band and gospel. In the article "Popular Song (USA)," for instance, Gammond traces our popular musical heritage from "Yankee-Doodle," to "Jump, Jim Crow" (a popular minstrel tune that was America's first international song hit in 1832), to "Dixie" (written by Northerner Daniel Decatur Emmett in 1859), to "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny" (written by James Bland, the first great Afro-American songwriter), to "Alexander's Ragtime Band" and the enormous outpouring of song in the 20th century. As in any Oxford Companion, one of the great pleasures is the discovery of odd, colorful details--for example, that "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow" may date back to the time of the Crusades, or that singer Frankie Laine (who recorded "Rawhide" and other hit tunes) holds the all-time dance marathon record: 3,501 hours in 145 consecutive days. And throughout, Gammond includes generous cross-referencing as well as helpful bibliographies for the larger entries. <br> This authoritative and comprehensive volume offers a matchless tour of the popular music world, providing a balance between substantial information and a concise assessment of the subject.</p><p>Okay, it's the <i>Oxford Companion,</i> which explains why so much space is devoted to English music-hall perennials such as Al Bowlly or Ray Noble. But this wrist-wrenching book covers the other bases, too, with copious material on jazz, blues, reggae, country, folk, and even light opera.

Julia Roberts knits, high schoolers are knitting in the cafeteria, urbanites are knitting on the subway, college students are knitting in the dorms, and bookstores are sponsoring knitting groups. Colorful new yarns, the availability of simple patterns, gift giving, stress relief - all are reasons for picking up knitting needles and getting started on a great project.<p> Though knitting is growing in popularity, knitters still want projects that are fast and easy, but ultimately useful and attractive. KNIT MITTENS! is a colorful die-cut book that's small enough to tuck into a knitting bag, backpack, or purse.</p><p> The book begins with an easy-to-understand, illustrated overview of the basic techniques followed by 15 fun project patterns (with instructions for a range of sizes) bound between sturdy, die-cut board covers. Each pattern includes the following: a close-to-life-size color photo of the completed mitten or hat; a brief introduction to the pattern; materials and equipment lists; gauge information; a color chart; special tips and hints; and a detailed drawing of any unusual techniques involved. Because the rich palette flows through each book, knitters can mix and match hats (in Knit Hats!) and mittens to create unique sets. </p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Gwen W.

Most are quick and easy to knit and, because they take a small amount of yarn, they are relatively inexpensive as well. Usually knitted all in one piece ("in the round"), a hat is really a three-dimensional sculpture - you can see the hat taking shape as you knit. And whether you wear your hat or give it away, your unique creation is right out there for all to admire.</p><p> For this collection of patterns from seven North American designers, we've chosen a variety of styles for sizes ranging from baby to adults. Some are just plain fun, others are glamorous - all are practical and warm. If you're only beginning to knit and want something easy, or if you're more experienced but need a project you can do in a hurry, notice the patterns marked "Easy!" If you're looking for more of a challenge, the headbands on page 66 are the ideal introduction to double-knitting. And if you haven't experimented with felted knitting, take a look at the "sherpa" helmets for babies or the shaped hats for little girls or women on pages 76, 82, and 86.</p><p> A Good Yarn</p><p> One of the best things about knitting these days is the wonderful variety of colors, textures, and weights of yarns that easily lure you into yarn shops. When you're deciding what kind of yarn to choose - wool, mohair, cashmere, angora, alpaca, silk, rayon, cotton, linen, synthetic, and various blends - consider how the hat will be used and what the wearer prefers. Will this hat be worn for fun, or does it need to be thick and warm and fit over the ears? Many knitters prefer natural fibers for their hand knits. Wool, for instance, is considered warmer than acrylic, even when wet, but some folks find wool itchy, or they may even be allergic to it. If you're knitting a baby hat, a good compromise is washable wool, which is soft and easy to care for.</p><p> For two-color knitting, choose yarns of the same fibers and weight. Different yarn fibers have different degrees of elasticity, or they may differ in the way they knit up, hold their shape, and wash.</p><p> In terms of yarn quality, as with most products, you are likely to get what you pay for. Very inexpensive yarns stretch easily and pill and, in general, don't hold up well. Knitting is a fun hobby, but when you're putting time and effort into a project, you'll want it to last. Following are some general yarn categories and their average gauges and needle sizes.</p><p> Baby or fingering yarn 6.5 to 8 stitches = 1 inch US 0-3</p><p> Sport weight yarn 5.5 to 6 stitches = 1 inch US 4-6</p><p> DK (double knit) yarn 5 to 6 stitches = 1 inch US 4-6</p><p> Worsted weight yarn 4 to 5 stitches = 1 inch US 6-9</p><p> Bulky weight yarn 2 to 3.5 stitches = 1 inch US 9-11</p><p> Chunky weight yarn 3.5 to 4 stitches = 1 inch US 9-101/2</p><p> If you're substituting a yarn for the one recommended in a pattern, make sure you purchase the correct amount of yardage. For instance, if a pattern calls for one skein of a certain yarn that is packaged 190 yards to a skein and you want to substitute it with a yarn packaged in 100-yard skeins, you'll need to buy two skeins of the substitute yarn. You can usually find this information right on the label, or ask the yarn shop. You'll find yarns come in circular skeins that must be wound into balls before use, as well as in pull-out skeins that don't need rewinding; for a smoother feed, take the yarn from the inside of these skeins.</p><p> It's always best to buy an extra skein or two to avoid running short. If you have to return for more yarn, you may find that the yarn shop is either out of it or that what they have is from a different dye lot, which means the colors may be slightly but noticeably different. Some yarn shops will set aside an additional skein for up to a month, just in case you need another; most shops will also accept unused skeins for cash or credit.</p><p> Need Some Needles?</p><p> Most knitters have strong preferences when it comes to selecting knitting needles, and the wide variety of choices can be confusing until you try them. Coated aluminum needles are durable but sometimes heavy in larger sizes. Plastic or similar materials are lighter, though they can bend or break. Bamboo needles have become increasingly popular: yarn moves smoothly along bamboo needles, even in hot, sticky weather, and they're comfortable and quiet to use.</p><p> Available in several lengths, straight needles are easy to work with. Some people find shorter needles easier to manage. For projects that don't fit easily onto short, straight needles, use circular needles. You'll also need circular or double-pointed needles to knit cylindrical shapes, such as mittens and hats. Most of the hats in this book are knit in the round on circular or double-pointed needles. Circular needles come in different lengths and have a flexible nylon or plastic center. The 16-inch length is usually most appropriate for adult-size hats.</p><p> Double-pointed needles are used for knitting in the round. You may need to switch from circular to double-pointed needles when you're decreasing a hat to make the top of the crown, and the stitches on the circular needle stretch too far apart to work. When possible, choose a set of double-pointed needles that comes five to a package. Some patterns require five needles, but even if not, it's always good to have the extra needle in case you lose one. You also need a set of crochet hooks for picking up dropped stitches, weaving in ends, and finishing some edges.</p><p> Needles come in numbered sizes, but it's important to note whether the size is US, UK, or metric - they're all different! You'll quickly notice that in the US system, 0 is very small; in the UK system, 0 is large. This book provides US and metric sizes in all the instructions.</p><p> Getting Gauge Right</p><p> It may seem like a nuisance, but, in the long run, knitting an accurate stitch gauge with the yarn and needles you'll be using for your project is one of the most important knitting techniques - no matter how experienced you are as a knitter. The stitch gauge (sometimes called tension) is the number of stitches per inch that you need to make to produce the right size. Obtaining the right gauge can make the difference between a hat that fits properly and one that is unwearable.</p><p> Always calculate your gauge over 4 inches (10cm). That's because counting stitches over 1 inch (2.5cm) can be misleading if your stitches are uneven or if the recommended stitches per inch contains a fraction. Here's an example of how to knit a swatch and figure out gauge:</p><p> Say a pattern lists the gauge as 16 stitches = 4 inches on size 7 needles. Use size 7 needles to cast on 20 stitches (this is the number of gauge stitches, plus a few extra so that you don't need to measure the edge stitches, which may be uneven).</p><p> Following the stitch pattern you'll be using for the main part of your project (unless the pattern indicates otherwise), knit a swatch about 4 inches long. Do not block the swatch.</p><p> Lay the swatch on a firm, flat surface. Take care not to stretch the swatch, and make sure the side edges are uncurled. Lay a flat ruler from one side of the swatch to the other. Count the number of stitches within 4 inches (10cm). There should be exactly 16.</p><p> If your swatch contains more than 16 stitches in 4 inches, use larger needles and knit another swatch. Repeat steps 1 through 3.</p><p> 5. If your swatch contains fewer than 16 stitches in 4 inches, use smaller needles and knit another swatch. Repeat steps 1 through 3.</p><p> Note: Always use fresh yarn to make a swatch. Used yarn may be stretched and thus give an in-accurate measurement.</p><p> Also, two needle sizes are sometimes specified for a pattern, the larger for the main body of the hat, and the smaller for ribbing, for instance. If you change your larger-size needle to obtain the correct stitch gauge, adjust the size of the smaller needle to correspond.</p><p> It's Only Fitting</p><p> Most of the hats in this book can be knitted in several sizes. To obtain the best fit, measure the circumference of the wearer's head before you knit, and use the instructions for the size closest to that measurement. No one wants a hat to slip around, so the hat circumference may be smaller than the head it's designed to fit. The difference between head and hat size can vary, depending on the hat's "cuff" (for example, rolled stockinette stitch or ribbing) and the type of yarn (stretchy or firm).</p><p> To measure head size, begin at the top middle of the forehead just below the hairline. Run a tape measure in front of the ears, around the back of the neck, and back up to the forehead. Compare that to the average head sizes listed below. Unless otherwise noted in the pattern, refer to these measurements when you decide which size to knit.</p><p> Casting Call</p><p> Casting on with a long-tail cast on makes an especially neat, firm, but elastic edge for a hat cuff. If you tend to cast on tightly, you may want to switch to one needle size larger for this part.</p><p> 1. Estimate how long to make the "tail" by wrapping the yarn around the needle one time for each cast-on stitch you need, then adding a few extra inches. Make a slip knot right here, and slide the knot over a single knitting needle. Hold that needle in your right hand; hold the tail and the working end of the yarn in your left hand. Insert needle through front loop of working yarn loop on your thumb. Wrap tail from back to front around needle.</p><p> 2. Use needle to draw tail through the loop on your thumb.</p><p> 3. Release loop on your thumb, place your thumb underneath the working thread, and draw both toward you while holding the working thread and tail firmly in your fingers.</p><p> Casting off is sometimes called binding off. If you tend to cast off tightly, you may want to switch to one needle size larger. The simplest way to cast off is to knit two stitches to the right-hand needle, then draw the first one over the second. Don't pull too tightly, or your edge will be puckered and inelastic. When you reach the last stitch, pull the working end through the stitch and weave it into the inside. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>No Room for Secrets</h2><p>The reader and I are only interested in the truth. Recklessly generously illustrated. This is the book I&#39;ve been secretly longing to write. There is so much in my overstuffed life that I&#39;ve never talked about publicly before. All the things I love and dread are here: objects, photographs, people, letters, ideas, regrets, memories, journeys, being a model in the sixties, a daughter of the regiment, a friend of Dirk Bogarde; things I believe in, people I&#39;ve met and can&#39;t forget; slumming it, lording it, failure and survival. I wanted to write about eyeliner as well as sleeping under shrunken heads in a longhouse; being an honorary New Yorker, death (and why I think about it daily) and how to get thinner fast. To give it structure I have devised a framework which is in fact, My House. I shall show the reader into every room, from front door to attic window, walking through the (colossally) sustained metaphor of my life, answering questions (which I have cunningly put) about all the stuff in the place; my things: me. Why are you photographed with the Dalai Lama? Is this the teddy bear you had on your bed at school? Did you draw this picture of your son? Why did you make these pathetic curtains? Who are you? Do you lie to the press?</p><p>Joanna Lumley was born in India and grew up in England and the Far East.
